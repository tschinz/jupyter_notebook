      "YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The\n",
      "Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter.  That book was made\n",
      "by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly.  There was things\n",
      "which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.  That is nothing.  I\n",
      "never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt\n",
      "Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.  Aunt PollyTom's Aunt Polly, she\n",
      "isand Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which\n",
      "is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now the way that the book winds up is this:  Tom and me found the money\n",
      "that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.  We got six\n",
      "thousand dollars apieceall gold.  It was an awful sight of money when\n",
      "it was piled up.  Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out\n",
      "at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year\n",
      "roundmore than a body could tell what to do with.  The Widow Douglas\n",
      "she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was\n",
      "rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular\n",
      "and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand\n",
      "it no longer I lit out.  I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead\n",
      "again, and was free and satisfied.  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and\n",
      "said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I\n",
      "would go back to the widow and be respectable.  So I went back.\n",
      "\n",
      "The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she\n",
      "called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by\n",
      "it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but\n",
      "sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up.  Well, then, the old thing\n",
      "commenced again.  The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come\n",
      "to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but\n",
      "you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little\n",
      "over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with\n",
      "them,that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself.  In a\n",
      "barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the\n",
      "juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.\n",
      "\n",
      "After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the\n",
      "Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and\n",
      "by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so\n",
      "then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in\n",
      "dead people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me.  But she\n",
      "wouldn't.  She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must\n",
      "try to not do it any more.  That is just the way with some people.  They\n",
      "get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it.  Here she was\n",
      "a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,\n",
      "being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a\n",
      "thing that had some good in it.  And she took snuff, too; of course that\n",
      "was all right, because she done it herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,\n",
      "had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a\n",
      "spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then\n",
      "the widow made her ease up.  I couldn't stood it much longer.  Then for\n",
      "an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety.  Miss Watson would say,\n",
      "\"Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;\" and \"Don't scrunch up\n",
      "like that, Huckleberryset up straight;\" and pretty soon she would\n",
      "say, \"Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberrywhy don't you try to\n",
      "behave?\"  Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished\n",
      "I was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm.  All I wanted\n",
      "was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular.\n",
      " She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for\n",
      "the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.\n",
      " Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I\n",
      "made up my mind I wouldn't try for it.  But I never said so, because it\n",
      "would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good\n",
      "place.  She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all\n",
      "day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever.  So I didn't think\n",
      "much of it. But I never said so.  I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer\n",
      "would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight.  I was glad\n",
      "about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\n",
      " By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\n",
      "everybody was off to bed.  I went up to my room with a piece of candle,\n",
      "and put it on the table.  Then I set down in a chair by the window and\n",
      "tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use.  I felt\n",
      "so lonesome I most wished I was dead.  The stars were shining, and the\n",
      "leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away\n",
      "off, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a\n",
      "dog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying\n",
      "to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so\n",
      "it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard\n",
      "that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about\n",
      "something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so\n",
      "can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night\n",
      "grieving.  I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some\n",
      "company.  Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I\n",
      "flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it\n",
      "was all shriveled up.  I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was\n",
      "an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared\n",
      "and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my\n",
      "tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied\n",
      "up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away.  But\n",
      "I hadn't no confidence.  You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that\n",
      "you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever\n",
      "heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed\n",
      "a spider.\n",
      "\n",
      "I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke;\n",
      "for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't\n",
      "know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town\n",
      "go boomboomboomtwelve licks; and all still againstiller than\n",
      "ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the\n",
      "treessomething was a stirring.  I set still and listened.  Directly I\n",
      "could just barely hear a \"me-yow! me-yow!\" down there.  That was good!\n",
      " Says I, \"me-yow! me-yow!\" as soft as I could, and then I put out the\n",
      "light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed.  Then I slipped\n",
      "down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough,\n",
      "there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER II.\n",
      "\n",
      "WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of\n",
      "the widow's garden, stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our\n",
      "heads. When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made\n",
      "a noise.  We scrouched down and laid still.  Miss Watson's big nigger,\n",
      "named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty\n",
      "clear, because there was a light behind him.  He got up and stretched\n",
      "his neck out about a minute, listening.  Then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who dah?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He listened some more; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right\n",
      "between us; we could a touched him, nearly.  Well, likely it was\n",
      "minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound, and we all there so close\n",
      "together.  There was a place on my ankle that got to itching, but I\n",
      "dasn't scratch it; and then my ear begun to itch; and next my back,\n",
      "right between my shoulders.  Seemed like I'd die if I couldn't scratch.\n",
      " Well, I've noticed that thing plenty times since.  If you are with\n",
      "the quality, or at a funeral, or trying to go to sleep when you ain't\n",
      "sleepyif you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch, why\n",
      "you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places. Pretty soon Jim\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Say, who is you?  Whar is you?  Dog my cats ef I didn' hear sumf'n.\n",
      "Well, I know what I's gwyne to do:  I's gwyne to set down here and\n",
      "listen tell I hears it agin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom.  He leaned his back up\n",
      "against a tree, and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched\n",
      "one of mine.  My nose begun to itch.  It itched till the tears come into\n",
      "my eyes.  But I dasn't scratch.  Then it begun to itch on the inside.\n",
      "Next I got to itching underneath.  I didn't know how I was going to set\n",
      "still. This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes; but\n",
      "it seemed a sight longer than that.  I was itching in eleven different\n",
      "places now.  I reckoned I couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer,\n",
      "but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try.  Just then Jim begun\n",
      "to breathe heavy; next he begun to snoreand then I was pretty soon\n",
      "comfortable again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom he made a sign to mekind of a little noise with his mouthand we\n",
      "went creeping away on our hands and knees.  When we was ten foot off Tom\n",
      "whispered to me, and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun.  But I said\n",
      "no; he might wake and make a disturbance, and then they'd find out I\n",
      "warn't in. Then Tom said he hadn't got candles enough, and he would slip\n",
      "in the kitchen and get some more.  I didn't want him to try.  I said Jim\n",
      "might wake up and come.  But Tom wanted to resk it; so we slid in there\n",
      "and got three candles, and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay.\n",
      "Then we got out, and I was in a sweat to get away; but nothing would do\n",
      "Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was, on his hands and knees, and play\n",
      "something on him.  I waited, and it seemed a good while, everything was\n",
      "so still and lonesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path, around the garden fence,\n",
      "and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of\n",
      "the house.  Tom said he slipped Jim's hat off of his head and hung it\n",
      "on a limb right over him, and Jim stirred a little, but he didn't wake.\n",
      "Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance,\n",
      "and rode him all over the State, and then set him under the trees again,\n",
      "and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it.  And next time Jim told\n",
      "it he said they rode him down to New Orleans; and, after that, every\n",
      "time he told it he spread it more and more, till by and by he said they\n",
      "rode him all over the world, and tired him most to death, and his back\n",
      "was all over saddle-boils.  Jim was monstrous proud about it, and he\n",
      "got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers.  Niggers would come\n",
      "miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any\n",
      "nigger in that country.  Strange niggers would stand with their mouths\n",
      "open and look him all over, same as if he was a wonder.  Niggers is\n",
      "always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire; but\n",
      "whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things,\n",
      "Jim would happen in and say, \"Hm!  What you know 'bout witches?\" and\n",
      "that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat.  Jim always kept\n",
      "that five-center piece round his neck with a string, and said it was a\n",
      "charm the devil give to him with his own hands, and told him he could\n",
      "cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by\n",
      "saying something to it; but he never told what it was he said to it.\n",
      " Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they\n",
      "had, just for a sight of that five-center piece; but they wouldn't touch\n",
      "it, because the devil had had his hands on it.  Jim was most ruined for\n",
      "a servant, because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil\n",
      "and been rode by witches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down\n",
      "into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling, where\n",
      "there was sick folks, maybe; and the stars over us was sparkling ever\n",
      "so fine; and down by the village was the river, a whole mile broad, and\n",
      "awful still and grand.  We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and\n",
      "Ben Rogers, and two or three more of the boys, hid in the old tanyard.\n",
      " So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half,\n",
      "to the big scar on the hillside, and went ashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "We went to a clump of bushes, and Tom made everybody swear to keep the\n",
      "secret, and then showed them a hole in the hill, right in the thickest\n",
      "part of the bushes.  Then we lit the candles, and crawled in on our\n",
      "hands and knees.  We went about two hundred yards, and then the cave\n",
      "opened up. Tom poked about amongst the passages, and pretty soon ducked\n",
      "under a wall where you wouldn't a noticed that there was a hole.  We\n",
      "went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room, all damp and\n",
      "sweaty and cold, and there we stopped.  Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now, we'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer's Gang.\n",
      "Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath, and write his name\n",
      "in blood.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody was willing.  So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had\n",
      "wrote the oath on, and read it.  It swore every boy to stick to the\n",
      "band, and never tell any of the secrets; and if anybody done anything to\n",
      "any boy in the band, whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and\n",
      "his family must do it, and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he\n",
      "had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts, which was the sign\n",
      "of the band. And nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that\n",
      "mark, and if he did he must be sued; and if he done it again he must be\n",
      "killed.  And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets, he\n",
      "must have his throat cut, and then have his carcass burnt up and the\n",
      "ashes scattered all around, and his name blotted off of the list with\n",
      "blood and never mentioned again by the gang, but have a curse put on it\n",
      "and be forgot forever.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath, and asked Tom if he got\n",
      "it out of his own head.  He said, some of it, but the rest was out of\n",
      "pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some thought it would be good to kill the _families_ of boys that told\n",
      "the secrets.  Tom said it was a good idea, so he took a pencil and wrote\n",
      "it in. Then Ben Rogers says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's Huck Finn, he hain't got no family; what you going to do 'bout\n",
      "him?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, hain't he got a father?\" says Tom Sawyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, he's got a father, but you can't never find him these days.  He\n",
      "used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard, but he hain't been seen\n",
      "in these parts for a year or more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They talked it over, and they was going to rule me out, because they\n",
      "said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill, or else it\n",
      "wouldn't be fair and square for the others.  Well, nobody could think of\n",
      "anything to doeverybody was stumped, and set still.  I was most ready\n",
      "to cry; but all at once I thought of a way, and so I offered them Miss\n",
      "Watsonthey could kill her.  Everybody said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, she'll do.  That's all right.  Huck can come in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with,\n",
      "and I made my mark on the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now,\" says Ben Rogers, \"what's the line of business of this Gang?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nothing only robbery and murder,\" Tom said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But who are we going to rob?houses, or cattle, or\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stuff! stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery; it's burglary,\"\n",
      "says Tom Sawyer.  \"We ain't burglars.  That ain't no sort of style.  We\n",
      "are highwaymen.  We stop stages and carriages on the road, with masks\n",
      "on, and kill the people and take their watches and money.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Must we always kill the people?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, certainly.  It's best.  Some authorities think different, but\n",
      "mostly it's considered best to kill themexcept some that you bring to\n",
      "the cave here, and keep them till they're ransomed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ransomed?  What's that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't know.  But that's what they do.  I've seen it in books; and so\n",
      "of course that's what we've got to do.\"\n",

      "\"But how can we do it if we don't know what it is?\"\n",

      "quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver\n",

      "from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball\n",
      "would take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the difference.  Jim smelt\n",
      "it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball\n",
      "would think it was good.  He said he would split open a raw Irish potato\n",
      "and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next\n",

      "there'd be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that\n",
      "to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd\n",
      "raise up and laugh at him.  But it warn't so this time.  It was a\n",
      "drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore.  Thinks\n",

      "about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a\n",
      "rough time tramping on foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man\n",

      "that was what made me so long.  I knowed he would see I was wet, and\n",
      "then he would be asking questions.  We got five catfish off the lines\n",
      "and went home.\n",
      "\n",
      "While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about\n",
      "wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you\n",

      "About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank.  The\n",
      "river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the\n",
      "rise. By and by along comes part of a log raftnine logs fast together.\n",
      " We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore.  Then we had dinner.\n",
      "Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch\n",
      "more stuff; but that warn't pap's style.  Nine logs was enough for one\n",
      "time; he must shove right over to town and sell.  So he locked me in and\n",
      "took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about half-past three.\n",
      " I judged he wouldn't come back that night.  I waited till I reckoned he\n",
      "had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that\n",
      "log again.  Before he was t'other side of the river I was out of the\n",
      "hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and\n",
      "shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same\n",
      "with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug.  I took all the coffee and\n",
      "sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the\n",
      "bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two\n",
      "blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot.  I took fish-lines and\n",
      "matches and other thingseverything that was worth a cent.  I cleaned\n",
      "out the place.  I wanted an axe, but there wasn't any, only the one out\n",
      "at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that.  I fetched\n",
      "out the gun, and now I was done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging\n",
      "out so many things.  So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside\n",
      "by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the\n",
      "sawdust.  Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two\n",
      "rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up\n",
      "at that place and didn't quite touch ground.  If you stood four or five\n",
      "foot away and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't never notice\n",
      "it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn't likely\n",
      "anybody would go fooling around there.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn't left a track.  I\n",
      "followed around to see.  I stood on the bank and looked out over the\n",
      "river.  All safe.  So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods,\n",
      "and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon\n",
      "went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie\n",
      "farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the axe and smashed in the door.  I beat it and hacked it\n",
      "considerable a-doing it.  I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly\n",
      "to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down\n",
      "on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was groundhard packed,\n",
      "and no boards.  Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks\n",
      "in itall I could dragand I started it from the pig, and dragged it to\n",
      "the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and\n",
      "down it sunk, out of sight.  You could easy see that something had been\n",
      "dragged over the ground.  I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he\n",
      "would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy\n",
      "touches.  Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as\n",
      "that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and\n",
      "stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner.  Then I\n",
      "took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't\n",
      "drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into\n",
      "the river.  Now I thought of something else.  So I went and got the bag\n",
      "of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house.\n",
      " I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the\n",
      "bottom of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the\n",
      "placepap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking.  Then\n",
      "I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through\n",
      "the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide\n",
      "and full of rushesand ducks too, you might say, in the season.  There\n",
      "was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went\n",
      "miles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river.  The meal\n",
      "sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake.  I dropped\n",
      "pap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by\n",
      "accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it\n",
      "wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some\n",
      "willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise.  I\n",
      "made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid\n",
      "down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan.  I says to myself,\n",
      "they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then\n",
      "drag the river for me.  And they'll follow that meal track to the lake\n",
      "and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers\n",
      "that killed me and took the things.  They won't ever hunt the river for\n",
      "anything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won't\n",
      "bother no more about me.  All right; I can stop anywhere I want to.\n",
      "Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well,\n",
      "and nobody ever comes there.  And then I can paddle over to town nights,\n",
      "and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's the\n",
      "place.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep.  When\n",
      "I woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute.  I set up and looked\n",
      "around, a little scared.  Then I remembered.  The river looked miles and\n",
      "miles across.  The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs\n",
      "that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from\n",
      "shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and _smelt_ late.\n",
      "You know what I meanI don't know the words to put it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start\n",
      "when I heard a sound away over the water.  I listened.  Pretty soon I\n",
      "made it out.  It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from\n",
      "oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night.  I peeped out through\n",
      "the willow branches, and there it wasa skiff, away across the water.\n",
      " I couldn't tell how many was in it.  It kept a-coming, and when it was\n",
      "abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it.  Think's I, maybe\n",
      "it's pap, though I warn't expecting him.  He dropped below me with the\n",
      "current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water,\n",
      "and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him.\n",
      " Well, it _was_ pap, sure enoughand sober, too, by the way he laid his\n",
      "oars.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't lose no time.  The next minute I was a-spinning down stream\n",
      "soft but quick in the shade of the bank.  I made two mile and a half,\n",
      "and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of\n",
      "the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and\n",
      "people might see me and hail me.  I got out amongst the driftwood, and\n",
      "then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float.\n",
      "\n",
      " I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking\n",
      "away into the sky; not a cloud in it.  The sky looks ever so deep when\n",
      "you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before.\n",
      " And how far a body can hear on the water such nights!  I heard people\n",
      "talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, tooevery word\n",
      "of it.  One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short\n",
      "nights now.  T'other one said _this_ warn't one of the short ones, he\n",
      "reckonedand then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they\n",
      "laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and\n",
      "laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said\n",
      "let him alone.  The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his\n",
      "old womanshe would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn't\n",
      "nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it\n",
      "was nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than\n",
      "about a week longer.  After that the talk got further and further away,\n",
      "and I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble,\n",
      "and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was away below the ferry now.  I rose up, and there was Jackson's\n",
      "Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and\n",
      "standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like\n",
      "a steamboat without any lights.  There warn't any signs of the bar at\n",
      "the headit was all under water now.\n",
      "\n",
      "It didn't take me long to get there.  I shot past the head at a ripping\n",
      "rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and\n",
      "landed on the side towards the Illinois shore.  I run the canoe into\n",
      "a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow\n",
      "branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe\n",
      "from the outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked\n",
      "out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town,\n",
      "three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling.  A\n",
      "monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down,\n",
      "with a lantern in the middle of it.  I watched it come creeping down,\n",
      "and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, \"Stern\n",
      "oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!\"  I heard that just as plain\n",
      "as if the man was by my side.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little gray in the sky now; so I stepped into the woods, and\n",
      "laid down for a nap before breakfast.\n",

      "CHAPTER VIII.\n",
      "\n",
      "THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight\n",
      "o'clock.  I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about\n",
      "things, and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied.  I\n",
      "could see the sun out at one or two holes, but mostly it was big trees\n",
      "all about, and gloomy in there amongst them.  There was freckled places\n",
      "on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves, and the\n",
      "freckled places swapped about a little, showing there was a little\n",
      "breeze up there.  A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me\n",
      "very friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was powerful lazy and comfortabledidn't want to get up and cook\n",
      "breakfast.  Well, I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep\n",
      "sound of \"boom!\" away up the river.  I rouses up, and rests on my elbow\n",
      "and listens; pretty soon I hears it again.  I hopped up, and went and\n",
      "looked out at a hole in the leaves, and I see a bunch of smoke laying\n",
      "on the water a long ways upabout abreast the ferry.  And there was the\n",
      "ferryboat full of people floating along down.  I knowed what was the\n",
      "matter now.  \"Boom!\" I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat's\n",
      "side.  You see, they was firing cannon over the water, trying to make my\n",
      "carcass come to the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was pretty hungry, but it warn't going to do for me to start a fire,\n",
      "because they might see the smoke.  So I set there and watched the\n",
      "cannon-smoke and listened to the boom.  The river was a mile wide there,\n",
      "and it always looks pretty on a summer morningso I was having a good\n",
      "enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to\n",
      "eat. Well, then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in\n",
      "loaves of bread and float them off, because they always go right to the\n",
      "drownded carcass and stop there.  So, says I, I'll keep a lookout, and\n",
      "if any of them's floating around after me I'll give them a show.  I\n",
      "changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could\n",
      "have, and I warn't disappointed.  A big double loaf come along, and I\n",
      "most got it with a long stick, but my foot slipped and she floated out\n",
      "further.  Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the\n",
      "shoreI knowed enough for that.  But by and by along comes another one,\n",
      "and this time I won.  I took out the plug and shook out the little dab\n",
      "of quicksilver, and set my teeth in.  It was \"baker's bread\"what the\n",
      "quality eat; none of your low-down corn-pone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got a good place amongst the leaves, and set there on a log, munching\n",
      "the bread and watching the ferry-boat, and very well satisfied.  And\n",
      "then something struck me.  I says, now I reckon the widow or the parson\n",
      "or somebody prayed that this bread would find me, and here it has gone\n",
      "and done it.  So there ain't no doubt but there is something in that\n",
      "thingthat is, there's something in it when a body like the widow or the\n",
      "parson prays, but it don't work for me, and I reckon it don't work for\n",
      "only just the right kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke, and went on watching.  The\n",
      "ferryboat was floating with the current, and I allowed I'd have a chance\n",
      "to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in\n",
      "close, where the bread did.  When she'd got pretty well along down\n",
      "towards me, I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread,\n",
      "and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.  Where\n",
      "the log forked I could peep through.\n",
      "\n",
      "By and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could\n",
      "a run out a plank and walked ashore.  Most everybody was on the boat.\n",
      " Pap, and Judge Thatcher, and Bessie Thatcher, and Jo Harper, and Tom\n",
      "Sawyer, and his old Aunt Polly, and Sid and Mary, and plenty more.\n",
      " Everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he's\n",
      "washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water's edge.  I\n",
      "hope so, anyway.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't hope so.  They all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly\n",
      "in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.  I could see\n",
      "them first-rate, but they couldn't see me.  Then the captain sung out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Stand away!\" and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that\n",
      "it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke, and\n",
      "I judged I was gone.  If they'd a had some bullets in, I reckon they'd\n",
      "a got the corpse they was after.  Well, I see I warn't hurt, thanks to\n",
      "goodness. The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder\n",
      "of the island.  I could hear the booming now and then, further and\n",
      "further off, and by and by, after an hour, I didn't hear it no more.\n",
      " The island was three mile long.  I judged they had got to the foot, and\n",
      "was giving it up.  But they didn't yet a while.  They turned around\n",
      "the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side,\n",
      "under steam, and booming once in a while as they went.  I crossed over\n",
      "to that side and watched them. When they got abreast the head of the\n",
      "island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and\n",
      "went home to the town.\n",
      "\n",
      "I knowed I was all right now.  Nobody else would come a-hunting after\n",
      "me. I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick\n",
      "woods.  I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things\n",
      "under so the rain couldn't get at them.  I catched a catfish and haggled\n",
      "him open with my saw, and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had\n",
      "supper.  Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking, and feeling pretty well\n",
      "satisfied; but by and by it got sort of lonesome, and so I went and set\n",
      "on the bank and listened to the current swashing along, and counted the\n",
      "stars and drift logs and rafts that come down, and then went to bed;\n",
      "there ain't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome; you\n",
      "can't stay so, you soon get over it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so for three days and nights.  No differencejust the same thing.\n",
      "But the next day I went exploring around down through the island.  I was\n",
      "boss of it; it all belonged to me, so to say, and I wanted to know\n",
      "all about it; but mainly I wanted to put in the time.  I found plenty\n",
      "strawberries, ripe and prime; and green summer grapes, and green\n",
      "razberries; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show.  They\n",
      "would all come handy by and by, I judged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warn't\n",
      "far from the foot of the island.  I had my gun along, but I hadn't shot\n",
      "nothing; it was for protection; thought I would kill some game nigh\n",
      "home. About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake,\n",
      "and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers, and I after\n",
      "it, trying to get a shot at it. I clipped along, and all of a sudden I\n",
      "bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking.\n",
      "\n",
      "My heart jumped up amongst my lungs.  I never waited for to look\n",
      "further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as\n",
      "fast as ever I could.  Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the\n",
      "thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear\n",
      "nothing else.  I slunk along another piece further, then listened again;\n",
      "and so on, and so on.  If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod\n",
      "on a stick and broke it, it made me feel like a person had cut one of my\n",
      "breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I got to camp I warn't feeling very brash, there warn't much sand\n",
      "in my craw; but I says, this ain't no time to be fooling around.  So I\n",
      "got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight,\n",
      "and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an\n",
      "old last year's camp, and then clumb a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "I reckon I was up in the tree two hours; but I didn't see nothing,\n",
      "I didn't hear nothingI only _thought_ I heard and seen as much as a\n",
      "thousand things.  Well, I couldn't stay up there forever; so at last I\n",
      "got down, but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the\n",
      "time. All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from\n",
      "breakfast.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time it was night I was pretty hungry.  So when it was good\n",
      "and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the\n",
      "Illinois bankabout a quarter of a mile.  I went out in the woods and\n",
      "cooked a supper, and I had about made up my mind I would stay there\n",
      "all night when I hear a _plunkety-plunk, plunkety-plunk_, and says\n",
      "to myself, horses coming; and next I hear people's voices.  I got\n",
      "everything into the canoe as quick as I could, and then went creeping\n",
      "through the woods to see what I could find out.  I hadn't got far when I\n",
      "hear a man say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We better camp here if we can find a good place; the horses is about\n",
      "beat out.  Let's look around.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't wait, but shoved out and paddled away easy.  I tied up in the\n",
      "old place, and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't sleep much.  I couldn't, somehow, for thinking.  And every time\n",
      "I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck.  So the sleep didn't\n",
      "do me no good.  By and by I says to myself, I can't live this way; I'm\n",
      "a-going to find out who it is that's here on the island with me; I'll\n",
      "find it out or bust.  Well, I felt better right off.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two, and\n",
      "then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows.  The moon was\n",
      "shining, and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day.\n",
      " I poked along well on to an hour, everything still as rocks and sound\n",
      "asleep. Well, by this time I was most down to the foot of the island.  A\n",
      "little ripply, cool breeze begun to blow, and that was as good as saying\n",
      "the night was about done.  I give her a turn with the paddle and brung\n",
      "her nose to shore; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge\n",
      "of the woods.  I sat down there on a log, and looked out through the\n",
      "leaves.  I see the moon go off watch, and the darkness begin to blanket\n",
      "the river. But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops,\n",
      "and knowed the day was coming.  So I took my gun and slipped off towards\n",
      "where I had run across that camp fire, stopping every minute or two\n",
      "to listen.  But I hadn't no luck somehow; I couldn't seem to find the\n",
      "place.  But by and by, sure enough, I catched a glimpse of fire away\n",
      "through the trees.  I went for it, cautious and slow.  By and by I was\n",
      "close enough to have a look, and there laid a man on the ground.  It\n",
      "most give me the fan-tods. He had a blanket around his head, and his\n",
      "head was nearly in the fire.  I set there behind a clump of bushes, in\n",
      "about six foot of him, and kept my eyes on him steady.  It was getting\n",
      "gray daylight now.  Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove\n",
      "off the blanket, and it was Miss Watson's Jim!  I bet I was glad to see\n",
      "him.  I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello, Jim!\" and skipped out.\n",
      "\n",
      "He bounced up and stared at me wild.  Then he drops down on his knees,\n",
      "and puts his hands together and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Doan' hurt medon't!  I hain't ever done no harm to a ghos'.  I alwuz\n",
      "liked dead people, en done all I could for 'em.  You go en git in de\n",

      "awluz yo' fren'.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I warn't long making him understand I warn't dead.  I was ever so\n",
      "glad to see Jim.  I warn't lonesome now.  I told him I warn't afraid of\n",
      "_him_ telling the people where I was.  I talked along, but he only set\n",
      "there and looked at me; never said nothing.  Then I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's good daylight.  Le's get breakfast.  Make up your camp fire good.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's de use er makin' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich\n",
      "truck? But you got a gun, hain't you?  Den we kin git sumfn better den\n",
      "strawbries.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Strawberries and such truck,\" I says.  \"Is that what you live on?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I couldn' git nuffn else,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, how long you been on the island, Jim?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I come heah de night arter you's killed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What, all that time?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yesindeedy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And ain't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sahnuffn else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you must be most starved, ain't you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I reck'n I could eat a hoss.  I think I could. How long you ben on de\n",
      "islan'?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Since the night I got killed.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No!  W'y, what has you lived on?  But you got a gun.  Oh, yes, you got\n",
      "a gun.  Dat's good.  Now you kill sumfn en I'll make up de fire.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So we went over to where the canoe was, and while he built a fire in\n",
      "a grassy open place amongst the trees, I fetched meal and bacon and\n",
      "coffee, and coffee-pot and frying-pan, and sugar and tin cups, and the\n",
      "nigger was set back considerable, because he reckoned it was all done\n",
      "with witchcraft. I catched a good big catfish, too, and Jim cleaned him\n",
      "with his knife, and fried him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot.\n",
      "Jim laid it in with all his might, for he was most about starved.  Then\n",

      "I wanted to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island\n",
      "that I'd found when I was exploring; so we started and soon got to it,\n",
      "because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile\n",
      "wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "This place was a tolerable long, steep hill or ridge about forty foot\n",
      "high. We had a rough time getting to the top, the sides was so steep and\n",
      "the bushes so thick.  We tramped and clumb around all over it, and by\n",
      "and by found a good big cavern in the rock, most up to the top on the\n",
      "side towards Illinois.  The cavern was as big as two or three rooms\n",
      "bunched together, and Jim could stand up straight in it.  It was cool in\n",
      "there. Jim was for putting our traps in there right away, but I said we\n",
      "didn't want to be climbing up and down there all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place, and had all the traps\n",
      "in the cavern, we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island,\n",
      "and they would never find us without dogs.  And, besides, he said them\n",
      "little birds had said it was going to rain, and did I want the things to\n",
      "get wet?\n",
      "\n",
      "So we went back and got the canoe, and paddled up abreast the cavern,\n",
      "and lugged all the traps up there.  Then we hunted up a place close by\n",
      "to hide the canoe in, amongst the thick willows.  We took some fish off\n",
      "of the lines and set them again, and begun to get ready for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one\n",
      "side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit, and was flat and a\n",
      "good place to build a fire on.  So we built it there and cooked dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there.\n",
      "We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern.  Pretty\n",
      "soon it darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was\n",
      "right about it.  Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury,\n",
      "too, and I never see the wind blow so.  It was one of these regular\n",
      "summer storms.  It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black\n",
      "outside, and lovely; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that\n",
      "the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby; and here would\n",
      "come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the\n",
      "pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would\n",
      "follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they\n",
      "was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and\n",
      "blackest_FST_! it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a little\n",
      "glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,\n",
      "hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again\n",
      "in a second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash,\n",
      "and then go rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the\n",
      "under side of the world, like rolling empty barrels down stairswhere\n",
      "it's long stairs and they bounce a good deal, you know.\n",
      "\n",

      "The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days, till at\n",
      "last it was over the banks.  The water was three or four foot deep on\n",
      "the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom.  On that side\n",
      "it was a good many miles wide, but on the Missouri side it was the same\n",
      "old distance acrossa half a milebecause the Missouri shore was just a\n",
      "wall of high bluffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe, It was mighty cool\n",
      "and shady in the deep woods, even if the sun was blazing outside.  We\n",
      "went winding in and out amongst the trees, and sometimes the vines hung\n",
      "so thick we had to back away and go some other way.  Well, on every old\n",
      "broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things; and\n",
      "when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame, on\n",
      "account of being hungry, that you could paddle right up and put your\n",
      "hand on them if you wanted to; but not the snakes and turtlesthey would\n",
      "slide off in the water.  The ridge our cavern was in was full of them.\n",
      "We could a had pets enough if we'd wanted them.\n",
      "\n",
      "One night we catched a little section of a lumber raftnice pine planks.\n",
      "It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long, and\n",
      "the top stood above water six or seven inchesa solid, level floor.  We\n",
      "could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes, but we let them go;\n",
      "we didn't show ourselves in daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another night when we was up at the head of the island, just before\n",
      "daylight, here comes a frame-house down, on the west side.  She was\n",
      "a two-story, and tilted over considerable.  We paddled out and got\n",
      "aboardclumb in at an upstairs window.  But it was too dark to see yet,\n",
      "so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island.  Then\n",
      "we looked in at the window.  We could make out a bed, and a table, and\n",
      "two old chairs, and lots of things around about on the floor, and there\n",
      "was clothes hanging against the wall.  There was something laying on the\n",
      "floor in the far corner that looked like a man.  So Jim says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hello, you!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But it didn't budge.  So I hollered again, and then Jim says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"De man ain't asleephe's dead.  You hold stillI'll go en see.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He went, and bent down and looked, and says:\n",

      "at his faceit's too gashly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't look at him at all.  Jim throwed some old rags over him, but\n",
      "he needn't done it; I didn't want to see him.  There was heaps of old\n",
      "greasy cards scattered around over the floor, and old whisky bottles,\n",
      "and a couple of masks made out of black cloth; and all over the walls\n",
      "was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal.\n",
      " There was two old dirty calico dresses, and a sun-bonnet, and some\n",
      "women's underclothes hanging against the wall, and some men's clothing,\n",
      "too.  We put the lot into the canoeit might come good.  There was a\n",
      "boy's old speckled straw hat on the floor; I took that, too.  And there\n",
      "was a bottle that had had milk in it, and it had a rag stopper for a\n",
      "baby to suck.  We would a took the bottle, but it was broke.  There was\n",
      "a seedy old chest, and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke.  They\n",
      "stood open, but there warn't nothing left in them that was any account.\n",
      " The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a\n",
      "hurry, and warn't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got an old tin lantern, and a butcher-knife without any handle, and\n",
      "a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store, and a lot of tallow\n",
      "candles, and a tin candlestick, and a gourd, and a tin cup, and a ratty\n",
      "old bedquilt off the bed, and a reticule with needles and pins and\n",
      "beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it, and a hatchet\n",
      "and some nails, and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some\n",
      "monstrous hooks on it, and a roll of buckskin, and a leather dog-collar,\n",
      "and a horseshoe, and some vials of medicine that didn't have no label\n",
      "on them; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb,\n",
      "and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow, and a wooden leg.  The straps\n",
      "was broke off of it, but, barring that, it was a good enough leg, though\n",
      "it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim, and we couldn't find\n",
      "the other one, though we hunted all around.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, take it all around, we made a good haul.  When we was ready to\n",
      "shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island, and it was pretty\n",
      "broad day; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the\n",
      "quilt, because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good\n",
      "ways off.  I paddled over to the Illinois shore, and drifted down most\n",

      "of it. Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time.  And he said\n",
      "that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadn't\n",
      "got to the end of it yet.  He said he druther see the new moon over his\n",

      "Well, the days went along, and the river went down between its banks\n",
      "again; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big\n",
      "hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was\n",
      "as big as a man, being six foot two inches long, and weighed over two\n",
      "hundred pounds. We couldn't handle him, of course; he would a flung us\n",
      "into Illinois.  We just set there and watched him rip and tear around\n",
      "till he drownded.  We found a brass button in his stomach and a round\n",
      "ball, and lots of rubbage.  We split the ball open with the hatchet,\n",
      "and there was a spool in it.  Jim said he'd had it there a long time, to\n",
      "coat it over so and make a ball of it.  It was as big a fish as was ever\n",
      "catched in the Mississippi, I reckon.  Jim said he hadn't ever seen\n",
      "a bigger one.  He would a been worth a good deal over at the village.\n",
      " They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house\n",

      "couldn't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl?\n",
      " That was a good notion, too.  So we shortened up one of the calico\n",
      "gowns, and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it.  Jim\n",
      "hitched it behind with the hooks, and it was a fair fit.  I put on the\n",
      "sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin, and then for a body to look in\n",
      "and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe.  Jim said\n",
      "nobody would know me, even in the daytime, hardly.  I practiced around\n",
      "all day to get the hang of the things, and by and by I could do pretty\n",
      "well in them, only Jim said I didn't walk like a girl; and he said\n",

      "little shanty that hadn't been lived in for a long time, and I wondered\n",
      "who had took up quarters there.  I slipped up and peeped in at the\n",

      "and was afeared maybe I was looking it, too.  I wished the woman would\n",
      "say something more; the longer she set still the uneasier I was.  But\n",
      "now she says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Honey, I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, the woman fell to talking about how hard times was, and how poor\n",
      "they had to live, and how the rats was as free as if they owned the\n",
      "place, and so forth and so on, and then I got easy again.  She was right\n",
      "about the rats. You'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner\n",
      "every little while.  She said she had to have things handy to throw at\n",
      "them when she was alone, or they wouldn't give her no peace.  She showed\n",
      "me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot, and said she was a good shot\n",
      "with it generly, but she'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago, and didn't\n",
      "know whether she could throw true now.  But she watched for a chance,\n",
      "and directly banged away at a rat; but she missed him wide, and said\n",
      "\"Ouch!\" it hurt her arm so.  Then she told me to try for the next one.\n",
      " I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back, but of course\n",
      "I didn't let on.  I got the thing, and the first rat that showed his\n",
      "nose I let drive, and if he'd a stayed where he was he'd a been a\n",
      "tolerable sick rat.  She said that was first-rate, and she reckoned I\n",
      "would hive the next one.  She went and got the lump of lead and fetched\n",
      "it back, and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help\n",
      "her with.  I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them, and\n",
      "went on talking about her and her husband's matters.  But she broke off\n",
      "to say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Keep your eye on the rats.  You better have the lead in your lap,\n",
      "handy.\"\n",

      "So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment, and I clapped\n",
      "my legs together on it and she went on talking.  But only about a\n",
      "minute. Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face,\n",
      "and very pleasant, and says:\n",

      "go back on her promise.  Then I told her my father and mother was dead,\n",
      "and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty\n",
      "mile back from the river, and he treated me so bad I couldn't stand it\n",
      "no longer; he went away to be gone a couple of days, and so I took my\n",
      "chance and stole some of his daughter's old clothes and cleared out, and\n",
      "I had been three nights coming the thirty miles.  I traveled nights,\n",
      "and hid daytimes and slept, and the bag of bread and meat I carried from\n",
      "home lasted me all the way, and I had a-plenty.  I said I believed my\n",
      "uncle Abner Moore would take care of me, and so that was why I struck\n",
      "out for this town of Goshen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goshen, child?  This ain't Goshen.  This is St. Petersburg.  Goshen's\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, a man I met at daybreak this morning, just as I was going to turn\n",
      "into the woods for my regular sleep.  He told me when the roads forked I\n",

      "\n",
      "\"He was drunk, I reckon.  He told you just exactly wrong.\"\n",

      "\"Hold on a minute.  I'll put you up a snack to eat.  You might want it.\"\n",

      "IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at\n",
      "last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow.  If a boat was to come\n",
      "along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois\n",
      "shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to\n",
      "put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat.  We\n",

      "\n",
      "If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I\n",

      "away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't no\n",
      "fault of mine.  I played it as low down on them as I could.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a\n",
      "big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with\n",
      "the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there\n",
      "had been a cave-in in the bank there.  A tow-head is a sandbar that has\n",
      "cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.\n",
      "\n",
      "We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois\n",
      "side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we\n",
      "warn't afraid of anybody running across us.  We laid there all day,\n",
      "and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and\n",
      "up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle.  I told Jim all\n",
      "about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was\n",
      "a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set\n",
      "down and watch a camp fireno, sir, she'd fetch a dog.  Well, then, I\n",
      "said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog?  Jim said he\n",
      "bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he\n",
      "believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that\n",
      "time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile\n",
      "below the villageno, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again.\n",
      " So I said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long\n",
      "as they didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the\n",
      "cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight;\n",
      "so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug\n",
      "wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things\n",
      "dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above\n",
      "the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of\n",
      "reach of steamboat waves.  Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a\n",
      "layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for\n",
      "to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather\n",
      "or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen.  We made an extra\n",
      "steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag\n",
      "or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern\n",
      "on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat\n",
      "coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have\n",
      "to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call\n",
      "a \"crossing\"; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being\n",
      "still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run the\n",

      "\n",
      "This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current\n",
      "that was making over four mile an hour.  We catched fish and talked,\n",
      "and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness.  It was kind of\n",
      "solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking\n",
      "up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it\n",
      "warn't often that we laughedonly a little kind of a low chuckle.  We\n",
      "had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to\n",
      "us at allthat night, nor the next, nor the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides,\n",
      "nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see.  The\n",
      "fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up.\n",
      "In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand\n",
      "people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful\n",
      "spread of lights at two o'clock that still night.  There warn't a sound\n",
      "there; everybody was asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little\n",
      "village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other\n",
      "stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting\n",
      "comfortable, and took him along.  Pap always said, take a chicken when\n",
      "you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy\n",
      "find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot.  I never see\n",
      "pap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to\n",
      "say, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a\n",
      "watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of\n",
      "that kind.  Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you\n",
      "was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't\n",
      "anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it.\n",
      " Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly\n",
      "right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things\n",
      "from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any morethen he reckoned\n",
      "it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others.  So we talked it over all\n",
      "one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds\n",
      "whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons,\n",
      "or what.  But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and\n",
      "concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons.  We warn't feeling just\n",
      "right before that, but it was all comfortable now.  I was glad the way\n",
      "it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmons\n",
      "wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning\n",
      "or didn't go to bed early enough in the evening.  Take it all round, we\n",
      "lived pretty high.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with\n",
      "a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid\n",
      "sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself.\n",
      "When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead,\n",
      "and high, rocky bluffs on both sides.  By and by says I, \"Hel-_lo_, Jim,\n",
      "looky yonder!\" It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock.\n",
      " We was drifting straight down for her.  The lightning showed her very\n",
      "distinct.  She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above\n",
      "water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a\n",
      "chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it,\n",
      "when the flashes come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like,\n",
      "I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck\n",
      "laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river.  I\n",
      "wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what\n",
      "there was there.  So I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Le's land on her, Jim.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Jim was dead against it at first.  He says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I doan' want to go fool'n 'long er no wrack.  We's doin' blame' well,\n",
      "en we better let blame' well alone, as de good book says.  Like as not\n",
      "dey's a watchman on dat wrack.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Watchman your grandmother,\" I says; \"there ain't nothing to watch but\n",
      "the texas and the pilot-house; and do you reckon anybody's going to resk\n",
      "his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when\n",
      "it's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?\"  Jim\n",
      "couldn't say nothing to that, so he didn't try.  \"And besides,\" I says,\n",
      "\"we might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom.\n",
      " Seegars, I bet youand cost five cents apiece, solid cash.  Steamboat\n",
      "captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and _they_ don't\n",
      "care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it.  Stick a\n",
      "candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging.\n",
      " Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing?  Not for pie, he\n",
      "wouldn't. He'd call it an adventurethat's what he'd call it; and he'd\n",
      "land on that wreck if it was his last act.  And wouldn't he throw style\n",
      "into it?wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing?  Why, you'd think it\n",
      "was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come.  I wish Tom Sawyer\n",
      "_was_ here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim he grumbled a little, but give in.  He said we mustn't talk any more\n",
      "than we could help, and then talk mighty low.  The lightning showed us\n",
      "the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and\n",
      "made fast there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deck was high out here.  We went sneaking down the slope of it to\n",
      "labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our\n",
      "feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so\n",
      "dark we couldn't see no sign of them.  Pretty soon we struck the forward\n",
      "end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in\n",
      "front of the captain's door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down\n",
      "through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we\n",
      "seem to hear low voices in yonder!\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come\n",
      "along.  I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just\n",
      "then I heard a voice wail out and say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, please don't, boys; I swear I won't ever tell!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Another voice said, pretty loud:\n",

      "\"It's a lie, Jim Turner.  You've acted this way before.  You always want\n",
      "more'n your share of the truck, and you've always got it, too, because\n",
      "you've swore 't if you didn't you'd tell.  But this time you've said\n",

      "this country.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time Jim was gone for the raft.  I was just a-biling with\n",
      "curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn't back out now,\n",
      "and so I won't either; I'm a-going to see what's going on here.  So I\n",
      "dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft\n",
      "in the dark till there warn't but one stateroom betwixt me and the\n",
      "cross-hall of the texas.  Then in there I see a man stretched on the\n",
      "floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one\n",
      "of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol.\n",
      " This one kept pointing the pistol at the man's head on the floor, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Bless yo' heart for them words, Jake Packard!  I'll never forgit you\n",

      "Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail\n",
      "and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill\n",
      "to come.  I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat\n",
      "slanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from getting\n",

      "\n",
      "And in he come, and Bill after him.  But before they got in I was up\n",
      "in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come.  Then they stood there,\n",
      "with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked.  I couldn't see\n",
      "them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having.\n",
      " I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much difference\n",

      "didn't breathe.  I was too scared.  And, besides, a body _couldn't_\n",

      "Well, the second night a fog begun to come on, and we made for a towhead\n",

      "I'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash\n",

      "When it was daylight, here was the clear Ohio water inshore, sure\n",
      "enough, and outside was the old regular Muddy!  So it was all up with\n",
      "Cairo.\n",
      "\n",
      "We talked it all over.  It wouldn't do to take to the shore; we couldn't\n",
      "take the raft up the stream, of course.  There warn't no way but to wait\n",
      "for dark, and start back in the canoe and take the chances.  So we slept\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "By and by we talked about what we better do, and found there warn't no\n",

      "a canoe to go back in.  We warn't going to borrow it when there warn't\n",
      "anybody around, the way pap would do, for that might set people after\n",

      "\n",
      "The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore.  But we\n",

      "more.  Well, the night got gray and ruther thick, which is the next\n",
      "meanest thing to fog.  You can't tell the shape of the river, and you\n",
      "can't see no distance. It got to be very late and still, and then along\n",
      "comes a steamboat up the river.  We lit the lantern, and judged she\n",
      "would see it.  Up-stream boats didn't generly come close to us; they\n",
      "go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs; but\n",
      "nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river.\n",
      "\n",
      "We could hear her pounding along, but we didn't see her good till she\n",
      "was close.  She aimed right for us.  Often they do that and try to see\n",
      "how close they can come without touching; sometimes the wheel bites off\n",
      "a sweep, and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs, and thinks\n",
      "he's mighty smart.  Well, here she comes, and we said she was going to\n",
      "try and shave us; but she didn't seem to be sheering off a bit.  She\n",
      "was a big one, and she was coming in a hurry, too, looking like a black\n",
      "cloud with rows of glow-worms around it; but all of a sudden she bulged\n",
      "out, big and scary, with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining\n",
      "like red-hot teeth, and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right\n",
      "over us.  There was a yell at us, and a jingling of bells to stop the\n",
      "engines, a powwow of cussing, and whistling of steamand as Jim went\n",
      "overboard on one side and I on the other, she come smashing straight\n",
      "through the raft.\n",

      "I divedand I aimed to find the bottom, too, for a thirty-foot wheel\n",
      "had got to go over me, and I wanted it to have plenty of room.  I could\n",
      "always stay under water a minute; this time I reckon I stayed under a\n",
      "minute and a half.  Then I bounced for the top in a hurry, for I was\n",
      "nearly busting.  I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of\n",
      "my nose, and puffed a bit.  Of course there was a booming current; and\n",
      "of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she\n",
      "stopped them, for they never cared much for raftsmen; so now she was\n",
      "churning along up the river, out of sight in the thick weather, though I\n",
      "could hear her.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sung out for Jim about a dozen times, but I didn't get any answer;\n",
      "so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was \"treading water,\" and\n",
      "struck out for shore, shoving it ahead of me.  But I made out to see\n",
      "that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore, which\n",
      "meant that I was in a crossing; so I changed off and went that way.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was one of these long, slanting, two-mile crossings; so I was a good\n",
      "long time in getting over.  I made a safe landing, and clumb up the\n",
      "bank. I couldn't see but a little ways, but I went poking along over\n",
      "rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more, and then I run across a\n",
      "big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it.  I was going to\n",
      "rush by and get away, but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling\n",

      "town. There warn't no bed in the parlor, nor a sign of a bed; but heaps\n",
      "of parlors in towns has beds in them.  There was a big fireplace that\n",
      "was bricked on the bottom, and the bricks was kept clean and red by\n",
      "pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick; sometimes\n",
      "they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown,\n",
      "same as they do in town.  They had big brass dog-irons that could hold\n",
      "up a saw-log. There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece, with\n",
      "a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front, and\n",
      "a round place in the middle of it for the sun, and you could see the\n",

      "and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her\n",
      "up and got her in good shape, she would start in and strike a hundred\n",

      "and when you pressed down on them they squeaked, but didn't open\n",
      "their mouths nor look different nor interested.  They squeaked through\n",
      "underneath.  There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out\n",

      "of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and\n",
      "grapes piled up in it, which was much redder and yellower and prettier\n",
      "than real ones is, but they warn't real because you could see where\n",

      "come all the way from Philadelphia, they said.  There was some books,\n",
      "too, piled up perfectly exact, on each corner of the table.  One was a\n",
      "big family Bible full of pictures.  One was Pilgrim's Progress, about a\n",
      "man that left his family, it didn't say why.  I read considerable in it\n",
      "now and then.  The statements was interesting, but tough.  Another was\n",
      "Friendship's Offering, full of beautiful stuff and poetry; but I didn't\n",
      "read the poetry.  Another was Henry Clay's Speeches, and another was Dr.\n",
      "Gunn's Family Medicine, which told you all about what to do if a body\n",
      "was sick or dead.  There was a hymn book, and a lot of other books.  And\n",
      "there was nice split-bottom chairs, and perfectly sound, toonot bagged\n",

      "They had pictures hung on the wallsmainly Washingtons and Lafayettes,\n",

      "daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only\n",
      "fifteen years old.  They was different from any pictures I ever see\n",
      "beforeblacker, mostly, than is common.  One was a woman in a slim black\n",
      "dress, belted small under the armpits, with bulges like a cabbage in\n",
      "the middle of the sleeves, and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with\n",
      "a black veil, and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape, and\n",
      "very wee black slippers, like a chisel, and she was leaning pensive on a\n",
      "tombstone on her right elbow, under a weeping willow, and her other hand\n",
      "hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule,\n",
      "and underneath the picture it said \"Shall I Never See Thee More Alas.\"\n",
      " Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight\n",
      "to the top of her head, and knotted there in front of a comb like a\n",
      "chair-back, and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird\n",
      "laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up, and underneath\n",
      "the picture it said \"I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas.\"\n",
      " There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the\n",
      "moon, and tears running down her cheeks; and she had an open letter in\n",
      "one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it, and she was\n",

      "the picture it said \"And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas.\"  These\n",
      "was all nice pictures, I reckon, but I didn't somehow seem to take\n",
      "to them, because if ever I was down a little they always give me the\n",
      "fan-tods.  Everybody was sorry she died, because she had laid out a lot\n",
      "more of these pictures to do, and a body could see by what she had done\n",
      "what they had lost.  But I reckoned that with her disposition she was\n",
      "having a better time in the graveyard.  She was at work on what they\n",
      "said was her greatest picture when she took sick, and every day and\n",
      "every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it\n",
      "done, but she never got the chance.  It was a picture of a young woman\n",
      "in a long white gown, standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump\n",
      "off, with her hair all down her back, and looking up to the moon, with\n",
      "the tears running down her face, and she had two arms folded across her\n",
      "breast, and two arms stretched out in front, and two more reaching up\n",
      "towards the moonand the idea was to see which pair would look best,\n",
      "and then scratch out all the other arms; but, as I was saying, she died\n",
      "before she got her mind made up, and now they kept this picture over the\n",
      "head of the bed in her room, and every time her birthday come they hung\n",
      "flowers on it.  Other times it was hid with a little curtain.  The young\n",
      "woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face, but there was so\n",
      "many arms it made her look too spidery, seemed to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive, and used to paste\n",
      "obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the\n",

      "family, dead ones and all, and warn't going to let anything come between\n",

      "alive, and it didn't seem right that there warn't nobody to make some\n",
      "about her now she was gone; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two\n",

      "as kind as he could beyou could feel that, you know, and so you had\n",
      "confidence.  Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he\n",

      "where he was.  Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine\n",
      "most alwaysI mean he made it seem like good weather.  When he turned\n",

      "Each person had their own nigger to wait on themBuck too.  My nigger\n",

      "round about and on the river, and dances and picnics in the woods\n",
      "daytimes, and balls at the house nights.  These people was mostly\n",

      "\"Well,\" says Buck, \"a feud is this way:  A man has a quarrel with\n",
      "another man, and kills him; then that other man's brother kills _him_;\n",
      "then the other brothers, on both sides, goes for one another; then the\n",
      "_cousins_ chip inand by and by everybody's killed off, and there ain't\n",

      "around so as to have the bullet holes in front, you know, and the old\n",

      "coward amongst them Shepherdsonsnot a one.  And there ain't no cowards\n",
      "amongst the Grangerfords either.  Why, that old man kep' up his end in a\n",
      "fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords, and come\n",
      "out winner.  They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got\n",
      "behind a little woodpile, and kep' his horse before him to stop the\n",

      "Grangerfords had to be _fetched_ homeand one of 'em was dead, and\n",

      "Next Sunday we all went to church, about three mile, everybody\n",
      "a-horseback. The men took their guns along, so did Buck, and kept\n",
      "them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall.  The\n",
      "Shepherdsons done the same.  It was pretty ornery preachingall about\n",
      "brotherly love, and such-like tiresomeness; but everybody said it was\n",
      "a good sermon, and they all talked it over going home, and had such\n",
      "a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and\n",
      "preforeordestination, and I don't know what all, that it did seem to me\n",

      "me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her,\n",
      "and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and\n",
      "not tell anybody, and I said I would.  Then she said she'd forgot her\n",
      "Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books,\n",
      "and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say\n",
      "nothing to nobody.  I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the\n",
      "road, and there warn't anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two,\n",
      "for there warn't any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor\n",

      "\n",
      "Says I to myself, something's up; it ain't natural for a girl to be in\n",
      "such a sweat about a Testament.  So I give it a shake, and out drops a\n",
      "little piece of paper with \"HALF-PAST TWO\" wrote on it with a pencil.  I\n",
      "ransacked it, but couldn't find anything else.  I couldn't make anything\n",
      "out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home\n",

      "she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and\n",
      "before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and\n",
      "said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody.  She was\n",
      "mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it\n",
      "made her powerful pretty.  I was a good deal astonished, but when I got\n",
      "my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I\n",
      "had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing,\n",
      "and I told her \"no, only coarse-hand,\" and then she said the paper\n",

      "play now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I went off down to the river, studying over this thing, and pretty soon\n",
      "I noticed that my nigger was following along behind.  When we was out\n",
      "of sight of the house he looked back and around a second, and then comes\n",
      "a-running, and says:\n",

      "\n",
      "\"All right; trot ahead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I followed a half a mile; then he struck out over the swamp, and waded\n",
      "ankle deep as much as another half-mile.  We come to a little flat piece\n",
      "of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines,\n",

      "in the time.  It was a monstrous big river down theresometimes a mile\n",
      "and a half wide; we run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as\n",
      "night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied upnearly always\n",
      "in the dead water under a towhead; and then cut young cottonwoods and\n",
      "willows, and hid the raft with them.  Then we set out the lines.  Next\n",
      "we slid into the river and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool\n",
      "off; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee\n",
      "deep, and watched the daylight come.  Not a sound anywheresperfectly\n",
      "stilljust like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs\n",
      "a-cluttering, maybe.  The first thing to see, looking away over the\n",
      "water, was a kind of dull linethat was the woods on t'other side; you\n",
      "couldn't make nothing else out; then a pale place in the sky; then more\n",
      "paleness spreading around; then the river softened up away off, and\n",
      "warn't black any more, but gray; you could see little dark spots\n",
      "drifting along ever so far awaytrading scows, and such things; and\n",
      "long black streaksrafts; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking; or\n",
      "jumbled up voices, it was so still, and sounds come so far; and by and\n",
      "by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the\n",
      "streak that there's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it\n",
      "and makes that streak look that way; and you see the mist curl up off\n",
      "of the water, and the east reddens up, and the river, and you make out a\n",
      "log-cabin in the edge of the woods, away on the bank on t'other side of\n",
      "the river, being a woodyard, likely, and piled by them cheats so you can\n",
      "throw a dog through it anywheres; then the nice breeze springs up, and\n",
      "comes fanning you from over there, so cool and fresh and sweet to smell\n",
      "on account of the woods and the flowers; but sometimes not that way,\n",
      "because they've left dead fish laying around, gars and such, and they\n",
      "do get pretty rank; and next you've got the full day, and everything\n",
      "smiling in the sun, and the song-birds just going it!\n",
      "\n",
      "A little smoke couldn't be noticed now, so we would take some fish off\n",
      "of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast.  And afterwards we would watch\n",
      "the lonesomeness of the river, and kind of lazy along, and by and by\n",
      "lazy off to sleep.  Wake up by and by, and look to see what done it, and\n",
      "maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream, so far off towards the\n",
      "other side you couldn't tell nothing about her only whether she was\n",
      "a stern-wheel or side-wheel; then for about an hour there wouldn't be\n",
      "nothing to hear nor nothing to seejust solid lonesomeness.  Next\n",
      "you'd see a raft sliding by, away off yonder, and maybe a galoot on it\n",
      "chopping, because they're most always doing it on a raft; you'd see the\n",
      "axe flash and come downyou don't hear nothing; you see that axe go\n",
      "up again, and by the time it's above the man's head then you hear the\n",
      "_k'chunk_!it had took all that time to come over the water.  So we\n",
      "would put in the day, lazying around, listening to the stillness.  Once\n",
      "there was a thick fog, and the rafts and things that went by was beating\n",
      "tin pans so the steamboats wouldn't run over them.  A scow or a\n",
      "raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and\n",
      "laughingheard them plain; but we couldn't see no sign of them; it made\n",

      "Soon as it was night out we shoved; when we got her out to about the\n",
      "middle we let her alone, and let her float wherever the current wanted\n",
      "her to; then we lit the pipes, and dangled our legs in the water, and\n",
      "talked about all kinds of thingswe was always naked, day and night,\n",
      "whenever the mosquitoes would let usthe new clothes Buck's folks made\n",
      "for me was too good to be comfortable, and besides I didn't go much on\n",

      "Sometimes we'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest\n",
      "time. Yonder was the banks and the islands, across the water; and maybe\n",
      "a sparkwhich was a candle in a cabin window; and sometimes on the water\n",
      "you could see a spark or twoon a raft or a scow, you know; and maybe\n",
      "you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts.\n",
      "It's lovely to live on a raft.  We had the sky up there, all speckled\n",
      "with stars, and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them, and\n",
      "discuss about whether they was made or only just happened.  Jim he\n",

      "them; well, that looked kind of reasonable, so I didn't say nothing\n",
      "against it, because I've seen a frog lay most as many, so of course it\n",
      "could be done. We used to watch the stars that fell, too, and see them\n",
      "streak down.  Jim allowed they'd got spoiled and was hove out of the\n",
      "nest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the\n",
      "dark, and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out\n",
      "of her chimbleys, and they would rain down in the river and look awful\n",
      "pretty; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and\n",
      "her powwow shut off and leave the river still again; and by and by her\n",
      "waves would get to us, a long time after she was gone, and joggle the\n",
      "raft a bit, and after that you wouldn't hear nothing for you couldn't\n",
      "tell how long, except maybe frogs or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "After midnight the people on shore went to bed, and then for two or\n",
      "three hours the shores was blackno more sparks in the cabin windows.\n",

      "Then the baldhead says:  \"No! you can't mean it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.  My great-grandfather, eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater, fled\n",
      "to this country about the end of the last century, to breathe the pure\n",
      "air of freedom; married here, and died, leaving a son, his own father\n",
      "dying about the same time.  The second son of the late duke seized the\n",
      "titles and estatesthe infant real duke was ignored.  I am the lineal\n",
      "descendant of that infantI am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater; and\n",
      "here am I, forlorn, torn from my high estate, hunted of men, despised\n",
      "by the cold world, ragged, worn, heart-broken, and degraded to the\n",
      "companionship of felons on a raft!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim pitied him ever so much, and so did I. We tried to comfort him, but\n",
      "he said it warn't much use, he couldn't be much comforted; said if we\n",
      "was a mind to acknowledge him, that would do him more good than most\n",
      "anything else; so we said we would, if he would tell us how.  He said we\n",
      "ought to bow when we spoke to him, and say \"Your Grace,\" or \"My Lord,\"\n",
      "or \"Your Lordship\"and he wouldn't mind it if we called him plain\n",
      "\"Bridgewater,\" which, he said, was a title anyway, and not a name; and\n",
      "one of us ought to wait on him at dinner, and do any little thing for\n",
      "him he wanted done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, that was all easy, so we done it.  All through dinner Jim stood\n",
      "around and waited on him, and says, \"Will yo' Grace have some o' dis or\n",
      "some o' dat?\" and so on, and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to\n",
      "him.\n",
      "\n",

      "didn't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on\n",
      "around that duke.  He seemed to have something on his mind.  So, along\n",
      "in the afternoon, he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Looky here, Bilgewater,\" he says, \"I'm nation sorry for you, but you\n",

      "\"No?\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, you ain't the only person that's had a secret of his birth.\"  And,\n",
      "by jings, _he_ begins to cry.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hold!  What do you mean?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bilgewater, kin I trust you?\" says the old man, still sort of sobbing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To the bitter death!\"  He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it,\n",
      "and says, \"That secret of your being:  speak!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "You bet you, Jim and me stared this time.  Then the duke says:\n",

      "\"You are what?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, my friend, it is too trueyour eyes is lookin' at this very moment\n",

      "trampled-on, and sufferin' rightful King of France.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, he cried and took on so that me and Jim didn't know hardly what to\n",
      "do, we was so sorryand so glad and proud we'd got him with us, too.\n",
      " So we set in, like we done before with the duke, and tried to comfort\n",
      "_him_. But he said it warn't no use, nothing but to be dead and done\n",
      "with it all could do him any good; though he said it often made him feel\n",
      "easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his\n",
      "rights, and got down on one knee to speak to him, and always called him\n",
      "\"Your Majesty,\" and waited on him first at meals, and didn't set down\n",
      "in his presence till he asked them. So Jim and me set to majestying him,\n",
      "and doing this and that and t'other for him, and standing up till he\n",
      "told us we might set down.  This done him heaps of good, and so he\n",
      "got cheerful and comfortable.  But the duke kind of soured on him, and\n",
      "didn't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going; still,\n",
      "the king acted real friendly towards him, and said the duke's\n",
      "great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good\n",
      "deal thought of by _his_ father, and was allowed to come to the palace\n",
      "considerable; but the duke stayed huffy a good while, till by and by the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer\n",

      "make things oncomfortable.  It ain't my fault I warn't born a duke,\n",
      "it ain't your fault you warn't born a kingso what's the use to worry?\n",
      " Make the best o' things the way you find 'em, says Ithat's my motto.\n",

      "\n",
      "The duke done it, and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it.  It took\n",
      "away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it, because\n",
      "it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the\n",

      "to be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "It didn't take me long to make up my mind that these liars warn't no\n",
      "kings nor dukes at all, but just low-down humbugs and frauds.  But I\n",
      "never said nothing, never let on; kept it to myself; it's the best way;\n",
      "then you don't have no quarrels, and don't get into no trouble.  If they\n",
      "wanted us to call them kings and dukes, I hadn't no objections, 'long as\n",
      "it would keep peace in the family; and it warn't no use to tell Jim, so\n",
      "I didn't tell him.  If I never learnt nothing else out of pap, I learnt\n",

      "THEY asked us considerable many questions; wanted to know what we\n",
      "covered up the raft that way for, and laid by in the daytime instead of\n",
      "runningwas Jim a runaway nigger?  Says I:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Goodness sakes! would a runaway nigger run _south_?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "No, they allowed he wouldn't.  I had to account for things some way, so\n",
      "I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My folks was living in Pike County, in Missouri, where I was born, and\n",
      "they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike.  Pa, he 'lowed\n",
      "he'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who's got a little\n",
      "one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans.  Pa was\n",
      "pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he'd squared up there warn't\n",
      "nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim.  That warn't\n",
      "enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way.\n",
      " Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched\n",
      "this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it.\n",
      " Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of\n",
      "the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel;\n",
      "Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four\n",
      "years old, so they never come up no more.  Well, for the next day or\n",
      "two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in\n",
      "skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was\n",
      "a runaway nigger.  We don't run daytimes no more now; nights they don't\n",
      "bother us.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we\n",
      "want to.  I'll think the thing overI'll invent a plan that'll fix it.\n",
      "We'll let it alone for to-day, because of course we don't want to go by\n",
      "that town yonder in daylightit mightn't be healthy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain; the heat\n",
      "lightning was squirting around low down in the sky, and the leaves was\n",
      "beginning to shiverit was going to be pretty ugly, it was easy to see\n",
      "that.  So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam, to see\n",
      "what the beds was like.  My bed was a straw tick better than Jim's,\n",
      "which was a corn-shuck tick; there's always cobs around about in a shuck\n",
      "tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry\n",
      "shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it\n",
      "makes such a rustling that you wake up.  Well, the duke allowed he would\n",
      "take my bed; but the king allowed he wouldn't.  He says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that\n",

      "take the shuck bed yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute, being afraid there was\n",
      "going to be some more trouble amongst them; so we was pretty glad when\n",
      "the duke says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"'Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of\n",
      "oppression.  Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit; I yield, I\n",

      "it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We got away as soon as it was good and dark.  The king told us to stand\n",
      "well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we\n",
      "got a long ways below the town.  We come in sight of the little bunch of\n",
      "lights by and bythat was the town, you knowand slid by, about a half\n",
      "a mile out, all right.  When we was three-quarters of a mile below we\n",
      "hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain\n",
      "and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us\n",
      "to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke\n",
      "crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night.  It was my watch\n",
      "below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway if I'd had a bed,\n",
      "because a body don't see such a storm as that every day in the week, not\n",
      "by a long sight.  My souls, how the wind did scream along!  And every\n",
      "second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half\n",
      "a mile around, and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain,\n",
      "and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK!bum!\n",
      "bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bumand the thunder would go rumbling\n",
      "and grumbling away, and quitand then RIP comes another flash and\n",
      "another sockdolager.  The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes,\n",
      "but I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't mind.  We didn't have no trouble\n",
      "about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant\n",
      "that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or\n",
      "that and miss them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I had the middle watch, you know, but I was pretty sleepy by that time,\n",
      "so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me; he was always\n",
      "mighty good that way, Jim was.  I crawled into the wigwam, but the king\n",
      "and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn't no show for\n",
      "me; so I laid outsideI didn't mind the rain, because it was warm, and\n",
      "the waves warn't running so high now.  About two they come up again,\n",
      "though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because\n",
      "he reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he was\n",
      "mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a\n",
      "regular ripper and washed me overboard.  It most killed Jim a-laughing.\n",
      " He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.\n",
      "\n",
      "I took the watch, and Jim he laid down and snored away; and by and by\n",
      "the storm let up for good and all; and the first cabin-light that showed\n",
      "I rousted him out, and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the\n",
      "day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him\n",
      "and the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game.  Then they got\n",
      "tired of it, and allowed they would \"lay out a campaign,\" as they called\n",
      "it. The duke went down into his carpet-bag, and fetched up a lot of\n",
      "little printed bills and read them out loud.  One bill said, \"The\n",
      "celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris,\" would \"lecture on the\n",

      "blank, at ten cents admission, and \"furnish charts of character at\n",
      "twenty-five cents apiece.\"  The duke said that was _him_.  In another\n",

      "Younger, of Drury Lane, London.\"  In other bills he had a lot of other\n",
      "names and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with\n",
      "a \"divining-rod,\" \"dissipating witch spells,\" and so on.  By and by he\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But the histrionic muse is the darling.  Have you ever trod the boards,\n",
      "Royalty?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" says the king.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You shall, then, before you're three days older, Fallen Grandeur,\" says\n",
      "the duke.  \"The first good town we come to we'll hire a hall and do the\n",

      "How does that strike you?\"\n",

      "\"I'm in, up to the hub, for anything that will pay, Bilgewater; but, you\n",
      "see, I don't know nothing about play-actin', and hain't ever seen much\n",
      "of it.  I was too small when pap used to have 'em at the palace.  Do you\n",

      "\"Easy!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right.  I'm jist a-freezn' for something fresh, anyway.  Le's\n",
      "commence right away.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was, and\n",
      "said he was used to being Romeo, so the king could be Juliet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But if Juliet's such a young gal, duke, my peeled head and my white\n",
      "whiskers is goin' to look oncommon odd on her, maybe.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, don't you worry; these country jakes won't ever think of that.\n",
      "Besides, you know, you'll be in costume, and that makes all the\n",
      "difference in the world; Juliet's in a balcony, enjoying the moonlight\n",
      "before she goes to bed, and she's got on her night-gown and her ruffled\n",
      "nightcap.  Here are the costumes for the parts.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He got out two or three curtain-calico suits, which he said was\n",
      "meedyevil armor for Richard III. and t'other chap, and a long white\n",
      "cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match.  The king was\n",
      "satisfied; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the\n",
      "most splendid spread-eagle way, prancing around and acting at the same\n",
      "time, to show how it had got to be done; then he give the book to the\n",
      "king and told him to get his part by heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend, and\n",
      "after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run\n",
      "in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim; so he allowed he would\n",
      "go down to the town and fix that thing.  The king allowed he would go,\n",
      "too, and see if he couldn't strike something.  We was out of coffee, so\n",
      "Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we got there there warn't nobody stirring; streets empty, and\n",
      "perfectly dead and still, like Sunday.  We found a sick nigger sunning\n",
      "himself in a back yard, and he said everybody that warn't too young or\n",
      "too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting, about two mile back in the\n",
      "woods.  The king got the directions, and allowed he'd go and work that\n",
      "camp-meeting for all it was worth, and I might go, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke said what he was after was a printing-office.  We found it;\n",
      "a little bit of a concern, up over a carpenter shopcarpenters and\n",
      "printers all gone to the meeting, and no doors locked.  It was a dirty,\n",
      "littered-up place, and had ink marks, and handbills with pictures of\n",
      "horses and runaway niggers on them, all over the walls.  The duke shed\n",
      "his coat and said he was all right now.  So me and the king lit out for\n",
      "the camp-meeting.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping, for it was a most\n",
      "awful hot day.  There was as much as a thousand people there from\n",
      "twenty mile around.  The woods was full of teams and wagons, hitched\n",
      "everywheres, feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep\n",
      "off the flies.  There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with\n",
      "branches, where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell, and piles of\n",
      "watermelons and green corn and such-like truck.\n",
      "\n",
      "The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds, only they was\n",
      "bigger and held crowds of people.  The benches was made out of outside\n",
      "slabs of logs, with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into\n",
      "for legs. They didn't have no backs.  The preachers had high platforms\n",
      "to stand on at one end of the sheds.  The women had on sun-bonnets;\n",
      "and some had linsey-woolsey frocks, some gingham ones, and a few of the\n",
      "young ones had on calico.  Some of the young men was barefooted, and\n",
      "some of the children didn't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen\n",
      "shirt.  Some of the old women was knitting, and some of the young folks\n",
      "was courting on the sly.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn.  He lined\n",
      "out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it,\n",
      "there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then\n",
      "he lined out two more for them to singand so on.  The people woke up\n",
      "more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some\n",
      "begun to groan, and some begun to shout.  Then the preacher begun to\n",
      "preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of\n",
      "the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front\n",
      "of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his\n",
      "words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up\n",
      "his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and\n",
      "that, shouting, \"It's the brazen serpent in the wilderness!  Look upon\n",
      "it and live!\"  And people would shout out, \"Glory!A-a-_men_!\"  And so\n",
      "he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, come to the mourners' bench! come, black with sin! (_Amen_!) come,\n",
      "sick and sore! (_Amen_!) come, lame and halt and blind! (_Amen_!) come,\n",
      "pore and needy, sunk in shame! (_A-A-Men_!) come, all that's worn and\n",
      "soiled and suffering!come with a broken spirit! come with a contrite\n",
      "heart! come in your rags and sin and dirt! the waters that cleanse\n",
      "is free, the door of heaven stands openoh, enter in and be at rest!\"\n",
      "(_A-A-Men_!  _Glory, Glory Hallelujah!_)\n",

      "comfortablethere must a been twenty of themand every lady with a\n",
      "lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang\n",
      "of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of\n",
      "dollars, and just littered with diamonds.  It was a powerful fine sight;\n",
      "I never see anything so lovely.  And then one by one they got up\n",

      "graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their\n",
      "heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and\n",

      "as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever\n",
      "_could_ think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I\n",

      "And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ringsaid he wanted to\n",
      "ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was.  They argued\n",
      "and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the whole show\n",
      "come to a standstill.  Then the people begun to holler at him and make\n",
      "fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that\n",
      "stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the\n",
      "benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, \"Knock him down! throw him\n",
      "out!\" and one or two women begun to scream.  So, then, the ringmaster\n",

      "disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more\n",
      "trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse.\n",
      " So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute\n",
      "he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around,\n",
      "with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the\n",
      "drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every\n",
      "jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing\n",
      "till tears rolled down.  And at last, sure enough, all the circus men\n",
      "could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation,\n",
      "round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging\n",
      "to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side,\n",
      "and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just crazy.  It\n",
      "warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger.\n",
      " But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle,\n",
      "a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and\n",
      "dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire\n",
      "too.  He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable\n",
      "as if he warn't ever drunk in his lifeand then he begun to pull off his\n",
      "clothes and sling them.  He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up\n",
      "the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he\n",
      "was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you\n",
      "ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly\n",
      "humand finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to\n",
      "the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and\n",
      "astonishment.\n",

      "NEXT day, towards night, we laid up under a little willow towhead out in\n",
      "the middle, where there was a village on each side of the river, and the\n",
      "duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns.  Jim\n",
      "he spoke to the duke, and said he hoped it wouldn't take but a few\n",
      "hours, because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to\n",
      "lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope.  You see, when we left him\n",
      "all alone we had to tie him, because if anybody happened on to him all\n",
      "by himself and not tied it wouldn't look much like he was a runaway\n",
      "nigger, you know. So the duke said it _was_ kind of hard to have to lay\n",
      "roped all day, and he'd cipher out some way to get around it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was uncommon bright, the duke was, and he soon struck it.  He dressed\n",
      "Jim up in King Lear's outfitit was a long curtain-calico gown, and a\n",
      "white horse-hair wig and whiskers; and then he took his theater paint\n",
      "and painted Jim's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead,\n",
      "dull, solid blue, like a man that's been drownded nine days.  Blamed if\n",
      "he warn't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see.  Then the duke took\n",
      "and wrote out a sign on a shingle so:\n",
      "\n",
      "Sick Arabbut harmless when not out of his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he nailed that shingle to a lath, and stood the lath up four or five\n",
      "foot in front of the wigwam.  Jim was satisfied.  He said it was a sight\n",
      "better than lying tied a couple of years every day, and trembling all\n",
      "over every time there was a sound.  The duke told him to make himself\n",
      "free and easy, and if anybody ever come meddling around, he must hop\n",
      "out of the wigwam, and carry on a little, and fetch a howl or two like\n",
      "a wild beast, and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone.\n",
      " Which was sound enough judgment; but you take the average man, and he\n",
      "wouldn't wait for him to howl.  Why, he didn't only look like he was\n",
      "dead, he looked considerable more than that.\n",
      "\n",
      "These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again, because there was\n",

      "the news might a worked along down by this time.  They couldn't hit no\n",
      "project that suited exactly; so at last the duke said he reckoned he'd\n",
      "lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldn't put up\n",
      "something on the Arkansaw village; and the king he allowed he would drop\n",
      "over to t'other village without any plan, but just trust in Providence\n",
      "to lead him the profitable waymeaning the devil, I reckon.  We had all\n",
      "bought store clothes where we stopped last; and now the king put his'n\n",
      "on, and he told me to put mine on.  I done it, of course.  The king's\n",
      "duds was all black, and he did look real swell and starchy.  I never\n",
      "knowed how clothes could change a body before.  Why, before, he looked\n",
      "like the orneriest old rip that ever was; but now, when he'd take off\n",
      "his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile, he looked that grand\n",
      "and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark,\n",
      "and maybe was old Leviticus himself.  Jim cleaned up the canoe, and I\n",
      "got my paddle ready.  There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away\n",
      "up under the point, about three mile above the townbeen there a couple\n",

      "a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Run her nose in shore,\" says the king.  I done it.  \"Wher' you bound\n",

      "\n",
      "\"For the steamboat; going to Orleans.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "I see.\n",

      "I done so, and then we all three started on again.  The young chap was\n",

      "He asked the king where he was going, and the king told him he'd come\n",
      "down the river and landed at the other village this morning, and now he\n",

      "William, too, for that matterbecause he was one of them kind that can't\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Because she's a big Orleans boat, and I was afeard she mightn't stop\n",

      "my ride, after all.  When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up\n",
      "another mile to a lonesome place, and then he got ashore and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now hustle back, right off, and fetch the duke up here, and the new\n",

      "\n",
      "I see what _he_ was up to; but I never said nothing, of course.  When\n",

      "tried to talk like an Englishman; and he done it pretty well, too, for\n",
      "a slouch. I can't imitate him, and so I ain't a-going to try to; but he\n",
      "really done it pretty good.  Then he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How are you on the deef and dumb, Bilgewater?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The duke said, leave him alone for that; said he had played a deef\n",

      "\n",
      "About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along,\n",
      "but they didn't come from high enough up the river; but at last there\n",
      "was a big one, and they hailed her.  She sent out her yawl, and we went\n",
      "aboard, and she was from Cincinnati; and when they found we only wanted\n",
      "to go four or five mile they was booming mad, and gave us a cussing, and\n",
      "said they wouldn't land us.  But the king was ca'm.  He says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and\n",
      "put off in a yawl, a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em, can't it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So they softened down and said it was all right; and when we got to the\n",
      "village they yawled us ashore.  About two dozen men flocked down when\n",
      "they see the yawl a-coming, and when the king says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher' Mr. Peter Wilks lives?\" they\n",
      "give a glance at one another, and nodded their heads, as much as to say,\n",
      "\"What d' I tell you?\"  Then one of them says, kind of soft and gentle:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm sorry sir, but the best we can do is to tell you where he _did_\n",
      "live yesterday evening.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash, and fell up\n",
      "against the man, and put his chin on his shoulder, and cried down his\n",

      "\"Alas, alas, our poor brothergone, and we never got to see him; oh,\n",
      "it's too, too hard!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he turns around, blubbering, and makes a lot of idiotic signs to\n",
      "the duke on his hands, and blamed if he didn't drop a carpet-bag and\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, the men gathered around and sympathized with them, and said all\n",

      "his brother's last moments, and the king he told it all over again on\n",
      "his hands to the duke, and both of them took on about that dead tanner\n",
      "like they'd lost the twelve disciples.  Well, if ever I struck anything\n",

      "their heads, so you could a heard a pin fall.  And when they got there\n",
      "they bent over and looked in the coffin, and took one sight, and then\n",
      "they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans, most; and\n",
      "then they put their arms around each other's necks, and hung their chins\n",
      "over each other's shoulders; and then for three minutes, or maybe four,\n",
      "I never see two men leak the way they done.  And, mind you, everybody\n",
      "was doing the same; and the place was that damp I never see anything\n",

      "t'other side, and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the\n",

      "to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it, and\n",
      "everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loudthe poor girls,\n",
      "too; and every woman, nearly, went up to the girls, without saying a\n",
      "word, and kissed them, solemn, on the forehead, and then put their hand\n",
      "on their head, and looked up towards the sky, with the tears running\n",

      "the duke with his hands, and the duke he looks at him stupid and\n",
      "leather-headed a while; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his\n",

      "of little knickknacks and jimcracks around, like girls brisken up a room\n",

      "\n",
      "So then I lit outfor bed, I said, meaning some time or another.  When\n",
      "I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over.  I says to myself,\n",
      "shall I go to that doctor, private, and blow on these frauds?  Nothat\n",
      "won't do. He might tell who told him; then the king and the duke would\n",
      "make it warm for me.  Shall I go, private, and tell Mary Jane?  NoI\n",
      "dasn't do it. Her face would give them a hint, sure; they've got the\n",
      "money, and they'd slide right out and get away with it.  If she was to\n",
      "fetch in help I'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with,\n",
      "I judge.  No; there ain't no good way but one.  I got to steal that\n",
      "money, somehow; and I got to steal it some way that they won't suspicion\n",
      "that I done it. They've got a good thing here, and they ain't a-going\n",
      "to leave till they've played this family and this town for all they're\n",
      "worth, so I'll find a chance time enough. I'll steal it and hide it; and\n",
      "by and by, when I'm away down the river, I'll write a letter and tell\n",
      "Mary Jane where it's hid.  But I better hive it tonight if I can,\n",
      "because the doctor maybe hasn't let up as much as he lets on he has; he\n",
      "might scare them out of here yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, thinks I, I'll go and search them rooms.  Upstairs the hall was\n",
      "dark, but I found the duke's room, and started to paw around it with\n",
      "my hands; but I recollected it wouldn't be much like the king to let\n",
      "anybody else take care of that money but his own self; so then I went to\n",
      "his room and begun to paw around there.  But I see I couldn't do nothing\n",
      "without a candle, and I dasn't light one, of course.  So I judged I'd\n",
      "got to do the other thinglay for them and eavesdrop.  About that time\n",
      "I hears their footsteps coming, and was going to skip under the bed; I\n",
      "reached for it, but it wasn't where I thought it would be; but I touched\n",
      "the curtain that hid Mary Jane's frocks, so I jumped in behind that and\n",
      "snuggled in amongst the gowns, and stood there perfectly still.\n",
      "\n",
      "They come in and shut the door; and the first thing the duke done was to\n",
      "get down and look under the bed.  Then I was glad I hadn't found the bed\n",
      "when I wanted it.  And yet, you know, it's kind of natural to hide under\n",
      "the bed when you are up to anything private.  They sets down then, and\n",
      "the king says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, what is it?  And cut it middlin' short, because it's better for\n",
      "us to be down there a-whoopin' up the mournin' than up here givin' 'em a\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, this is it, Capet.  I ain't easy; I ain't comfortable.  That\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Miss Mary Jane, you can't a-bear to see people in trouble, and I\n",
      "can'tmost always.  Tell me about it.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "_again_, say it _again_!\n",
      "\n",
      "I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much, and was in a close\n",

      "impatient and excited and handsome, but looking kind of happy and\n",
      "eased-up, like a person that's had a tooth pulled out.  So I went to\n",
      "studying it out.  I says to myself, I reckon a body that ups and tells\n",
      "the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks,\n",
      "though I ain't had no experience, and can't say for certain; but it\n",

      "don't look to me like the truth is better and actuly _safer_ than a lie.\n",
      " I must lay it by in my mind, and think it over some time or other, it's\n",
      "so kind of strange and unregular. I never see nothing like it.  Well, I\n",
      "says to myself at last, I'm a-going to chance it; I'll up and tell the\n",
      "truth this time, though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of\n",
      "powder and touching it off just to see where you'll go to. Then I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Mary Jane, is there any place out of town a little ways where you\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes; Mr. Lothrop's.  Why?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never mind why yet.  If I'll tell you how I know the niggers will see\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Four days!\" she says; \"I'll stay a year!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right,\" I says, \"I don't want nothing more out of _you_ than just\n",
      "your wordI druther have it than another man's kiss-the-Bible.\"  She\n",
      "smiled and reddened up very sweet, and I says, \"If you don't mind it,\n",
      "I'll shut the doorand bolt it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I come back and set down again, and says:\n",

      "it.  These uncles of yourn ain't no uncles at all; they're a couple of\n",

      "\n",

      "all the time, and told her every blame thing, from where we first struck\n",
      "that young fool going up to the steamboat, clear through to where she\n",
      "flung herself on to the king's breast at the front door and he kissed\n",
      "her sixteen or seventeen timesand then up she jumps, with her face\n",

      "\n",
      "\"The brute!  Come, don't waste a minutenot a _second_we'll have them\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" she says, \"what am I _thinking_ about!\" she says, and set right\n",
      "down again.  \"Don't mind what I saidplease don'tyou _won't,_ now,\n",

      "to answer questions but me; so I didn't want the plan to begin working\n",
      "till pretty late to-night.  I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Miss Mary Jane, I'll tell you what we'll do, and you won't have to stay\n",

      "\n",
      "\"A little short of four milesright out in the country, back here.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"And if it just happens so that I don't get away, but get took up along\n",

      "the little things that smooths people's roads the most, down here below;\n",
      "it would make Mary Jane comfortable, and it wouldn't cost nothing.  Then\n",

      "\"I wish I knowed, but I don't.  I _had_ it, because I stole it from\n",

      "just as sorry as I can be; but I done the best I could; I did honest.  I\n",
      "come nigh getting caught, and I had to shove it into the first place I\n",
      "come to, and runand it warn't a good place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, stop blaming yourselfit's too bad to do it, and I won't allow\n",

      "corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach.  So\n",
      "for a minute I didn't say nothing; then I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'd ruther not _tell_ you where I put it, Miss Mary Jane, if you don't\n",
      "mind letting me off; but I'll write it for you on a piece of paper, and\n",
      "you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop's, if you want to.  Do you\n",
      "reckon that 'll do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, yes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I wrote:  \"I put it in the coffin.  It was in there when you was\n",

      "\n",
      "It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by\n",
      "herself in the night, and them devils laying there right under her own\n",

      "to her I see the water come into her eyes, too; and she shook me by the\n",
      "hand, hard, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Good_-bye.  I'm going to do everything just as you've told me; and if\n",
      "I don't ever see you again, I sha'n't ever forget you and I'll think of\n",

      "gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pray for me!  I reckoned if she knowed me she'd take a job that was more\n",
      "nearer her size.  But I bet she done it, just the sameshe was just that\n",
      "kind.  She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notionthere\n",
      "warn't no back-down to her, I judge.  You may say what you want to, but\n",
      "in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see; in\n",
      "my opinion she was just full of sand.  It sounds like flattery, but it\n",
      "ain't no flattery.  And when it comes to beautyand goodness, tooshe\n",
      "lays over them all.  I hain't ever seen her since that time that I see\n",
      "her go out of that door; no, I hain't ever seen her since, but I reckon\n",
      "I've thought of her a many and a many a million times, and of her saying\n",
      "she would pray for me; and if ever I'd a thought it would do any good\n",
      "for me to pray for _her_, blamed if I wouldn't a done it or bust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, Mary Jane she lit out the back way, I reckon; because nobody see\n",

      "\"That's the name,\" I says; \"I most forgot it.  Well, Miss Mary Jane she\n",

      "they had me up to tell what I knowed.  The king he give me a left-handed\n",
      "look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the\n",
      "right side.  I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there,\n",
      "and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn't get pretty\n",
      "fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says:\n",

      "\n",
      "The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you'd been in town at first, Levi Bell\" The king broke in and\n",
      "reached out his hand, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, is this my poor dead brother's old friend that he's wrote so often\n",
      "about?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked\n",

      "\n",
      "\"That 'll fix it.  I'll take the order and send it, along with your\n",
      "brother's, and then they'll know it's all right.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted\n",
      "his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something;\n",
      "and then they give the pen to the dukeand then for the first time the\n",
      "duke looked sick.  But he took the pen and wrote.  So then the lawyer\n",
      "turns to the new old gentleman and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "powerful astonished, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, it beats _me_\"and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket,\n",
      "and examined them, and then examined the old man's writing, and then\n",
      "_them_ again; and then says:  \"These old letters is from Harvey Wilks;\n",
      "and here's _these_ two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn't\n",
      "write them\" (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell\n",
      "you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), \"and here's _this_ old\n",
      "gentleman's hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, _he_ didn't\n",
      "write themfact is, the scratches he makes ain't properly _writing_ at\n",
      "all.  Now, here's some letters from\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The new old gentleman says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If you please, let me explain.  Nobody can read my hand but my brother\n",
      "thereso he copies for me.  It's _his_ hand you've got there, not mine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Well_!\" says the lawyer, \"this _is_ a state of things.  I've got some\n",
      "of William's letters, too; so if you'll get him to write a line or so we\n",
      "can com\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He _can't_ write with his left hand,\" says the old gentleman.  \"If he\n",
      "could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters\n",
      "and mine too.  Look at both, pleasethey're by the same hand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The lawyer done it, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I believe it's soand if it ain't so, there's a heap stronger\n",
      "resemblance than I'd noticed before, anyway.  Well, well, well!  I\n",
      "thought we was right on the track of a solution, but it's gone to grass,\n",
      "partly.  But anyway, one thing is proved_these_ two ain't either of 'em\n",
      "Wilkses\"and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, what do you think?  That muleheaded old fool wouldn't give in\n",
      "_then_! Indeed he wouldn't.  Said it warn't no fair test.  Said his\n",
      "brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn't tried\n",
      "to write_he_ see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute\n",
      "he put the pen to paper.  And so he warmed up and went warbling and\n",
      "warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was\n",
      "saying _himself_; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I've thought of something.  Is there anybody here that helped to lay\n",
      "out my brhelped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes,\" says somebody, \"me and Ab Turner done it.  We're both here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the old man turns towards the king, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Blamed if the king didn't have to brace up mighty quick, or he'd a\n",
      "squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took\n",
      "him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make\n",
      "most _anybody_ sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any\n",
      "notice, because how was _he_ going to know what was tattooed on the man?\n",
      " He whitened a little; he couldn't help it; and it was mighty still in\n",
      "there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him.  Says\n",
      "I to myself, _now_ he'll throw up the spongethere ain't no more use.\n",
      " Well, did he?  A body can't hardly believe it, but he didn't.  I reckon\n",
      "he thought he'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so\n",
      "they'd thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away.\n",
      " Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Mf!  It's a _very_ tough question, _ain't_ it!  _yes_, sir, I k'n\n",
      "tell you what's tattooed on his breast.  It's jest a small, thin, blue\n",
      "arrowthat's what it is; and if you don't look clost, you can't see it.\n",
      " _now_ what do you sayhey?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out\n",
      "cheek.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and\n",
      "his eye lights up like he judged he'd got the king _this_ time, and\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Thereyou've heard what he said!  Was there any such mark on Peter\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Good!\" says the old gentleman.  \"Now, what you _did_ see on his breast\n",
      "was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was\n",
      "young), and a W, with dashes between them, so:  PBW\"and he marked\n",
      "them that way on a piece of paper.  \"Come, ain't that what you saw?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of them spoke up again, and says:\n",

      "\"No, we _didn't_.  We never seen any marks at all.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, everybody _was_ in a state of mind now, and they sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The whole _bilin_' of 'm 's frauds!  Le's duck 'em! le's drown 'em!\n",
      "le's ride 'em on a rail!\" and everybody was whooping at once, and there\n",

      "\n",
      "That took them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hooray!\" they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer\n",

      "\n",
      "I _was_ scared, now, I tell you.  But there warn't no getting away, you\n",
      "know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the\n",
      "graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole\n",

      "them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards.  It was the\n",
      "first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and\n",

      "First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn't make enough\n",

      "kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped\n",

      "over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break\n",
      "into somebody's house or store, or was going into the counterfeit-money\n",
      "business, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an\n",

      "shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we\n",

      "hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the\n",
      "back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers\n",

      "the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the _only_ one he's\n",
      "got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a close place.  I took it up, and held it in my hand.  I was\n",
      "a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and\n",
      "I knowed it.  I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then\n",

      "\n",
      "\"All right, then, I'll _go_ to hell\"and tore it up.\n",

      "Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some\n",
      "considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that\n",
      "suited me.  So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down\n",
      "the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my\n",
      "raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in.  I slept the\n",
      "night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast,\n",
      "and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or\n",
      "another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore.  I landed\n",
      "below where I judged was Phelps's place, and hid my bundle in the woods,\n",
      "and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and\n",
      "sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter\n",
      "of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on\n",
      "it, \"Phelps's Sawmill,\" and when I come to the farm-houses, two or\n",
      "three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn't\n",
      "see nobody around, though it was good daylight now.  But I didn't mind,\n",
      "because I didn't want to see nobody just yetI only wanted to get the\n",
      "lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from\n",
      "the village, not from below.  So I just took a look, and shoved along,\n",
      "straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was\n",
      "the duke.  He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuchthree-night\n",
      "performancelike that other time.  They had the cheek, them frauds!  I\n",
      "was right on him before I could shirk.  He looked astonished, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hel-_lo_!  Where'd _you_ come from?\"  Then he says, kind of glad and\n",
      "eager, \"Where's the raft?got her in a good place?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, that's just what I was going to ask your grace.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he didn't look so joyful, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What was your idea for asking _me_?\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" I says, \"when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says\n",
      "to myself, we can't get him home for hours, till he's soberer; so I went\n",
      "a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait.  A man up and offered\n",
      "me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch\n",
      "a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat,\n",
      "and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him\n",
      "along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after\n",
      "him.  We didn't have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the\n",
      "country till we tired him out.  We never got him till dark; then we\n",
      "fetched him over, and I started down for the raft.  When I got there and\n",
      "see it was gone, I says to myself, 'They've got into trouble and had to\n",
      "leave; and they've took my nigger, which is the only nigger I've got in\n",
      "the world, and now I'm in a strange country, and ain't got no property\n",
      "no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;' so I set down and\n",
      "cried.  I slept in the woods all night.  But what _did_ become of the\n",
      "raft, then?and Jimpoor Jim!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Blamed if I knowthat is, what's become of the raft.  That old fool had\n",
      "made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery\n",
      "the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but\n",
      "what he'd spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and\n",
      "found the raft gone, we said, 'That little rascal has stole our raft and\n",
      "shook us, and run off down the river.'\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wouldn't shake my _nigger_, would I?the only nigger I had in the\n",
      "world, and the only property.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We never thought of that.  Fact is, I reckon we'd come to consider him\n",
      "_our_ nigger; yes, we did consider him sogoodness knows we had trouble\n",
      "enough for him.  So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke,\n",
      "there warn't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another\n",
      "shake. And I've pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn.  Where's\n",
      "that ten cents? Give it here.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to\n",
      "spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the\n",
      "money I had, and I hadn't had nothing to eat since yesterday.  He never\n",
      "said nothing.  The next minute he whirls on me and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us?  We'd skin him if he done\n",
      "that!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How can he blow?  Hain't he run off?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "gone.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Sold_ him?\"  I says, and begun to cry; \"why, he was _my_ nigger, and\n",
      "that was my money.  Where is he?I want my nigger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, you can't _get_ your nigger, that's allso dry up your\n",
      "blubbering. Looky heredo you think _you'd_ venture to blow on us?\n",
      " Blamed if I think I'd trust you.  Why, if you _was_ to blow on us\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes\n",
      "before. I went on a-whimpering, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't want to blow on nobody; and I ain't got no time to blow, nohow.\n",
      "I got to turn out and find my nigger.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on\n",
      "his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead.  At last he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll tell you something.  We got to be here three days.  If you'll\n",
      "promise you won't blow, and won't let the nigger blow, I'll tell you\n",
      "where to find him.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I promised, and he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A farmer by the name of Silas Ph\" and then he stopped.  You see, he\n",
      "started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to\n",
      "study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind.  And so he\n",
      "was. He wouldn't trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of\n",
      "the way the whole three days.  So pretty soon he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The man that bought him is named Abram FosterAbram G. Fosterand he\n",
      "lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right,\" I says, \"I can walk it in three days.  And I'll start this\n",
      "very afternoon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No you wont, you'll start _now_; and don't you lose any time about it,\n",
      "neither, nor do any gabbling by the way.  Just keep a tight tongue in\n",
      "your head and move right along, and then you won't get into trouble with\n",
      "_us_, d'ye hear?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for.  I\n",
      "wanted to be left free to work my plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So clear out,\" he says; \"and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want\n",
      "to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim _is_ your niggersome\n",
      "idiots don't require documentsleastways I've heard there's such down\n",
      "South here.  And when you tell him the handbill and the reward's bogus,\n",
      "maybe he'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for\n",
      "getting 'em out.  Go 'long now, and tell him anything you want to; but\n",
      "mind you don't work your jaw any _between_ here and there.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I left, and struck for the back country.  I didn't look around, but I\n",
      "kinder felt like he was watching me.  But I knowed I could tire him out\n",
      "at that.  I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before\n",
      "I stopped; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps'.  I\n",
      "reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling\n",
      "around, because I wanted to stop Jim's mouth till these fellows could\n",
      "get away.  I didn't want no trouble with their kind.  I'd seen all I\n",

      "to by and by tag along and drop in, and let on to be a stranger.  But it\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Nonot impudent whelps, Sid.  You ought to had your jaws boxed; I\n",

      "We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and\n",

      "in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of\n",
      "old cold cannibal in the morning.  Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long\n",
      "blessing over it, but it was worth it; and it didn't cool it a bit,\n",
      "neither, the way I've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times.\n",
      " There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon, and me\n",
      "and Tom was on the lookout all the time; but it warn't no use, they\n",
      "didn't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger, and we was afraid\n",

      "it--it was as much as half-after eight, thenhere comes a raging rush of\n",
      "people with torches, and an awful whooping and yelling, and banging tin\n",
      "pans and blowing horns; and we jumped to one side to let them go by;\n",
      "and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a\n",

      "all over tar and feathers, and didn't look like nothing in the\n",
      "world that was humanjust looked like a couple of monstrous big\n",
      "soldier-plumes.  Well, it made me sick to see it; and I was sorry for\n",
      "them poor pitiful rascals, it seemed like I couldn't ever feel any\n",
      "hardness against them any more in the world.  It was a dreadful thing to\n",
      "see.  Human beings _can_ be awful cruel to one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "We see we was too latecouldn't do no good.  We asked some stragglers\n",
      "about it, and they said everybody went to the show looking very\n",
      "innocent; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the\n",
      "middle of his cavortings on the stage; then somebody give a signal, and\n",
      "the house rose up and went for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we poked along back home, and I warn't feeling so brash as I was\n",
      "before, but kind of ornery, and humble, and to blame, somehowthough\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it\n",
      "again when he came out.  He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up\n",

      "\n",

      "wouldn't trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown\n",
      "in a circus, nor nothing I can think of.  I went to thinking out a plan,\n",
      "but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right\n",

      "too blame' simple; there ain't nothing _to_ it.  What's the good of a\n",
      "plan that ain't no more trouble than that?  It's as mild as goose-milk.\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in\n",
      "earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery.\n",

      "without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to\n",
      "this business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame,\n",
      "before everybody.  I _couldn't_ understand it no way at all.  It was\n",
      "outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be\n",
      "his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save\n",
      "himself. And I _did_ start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Don't you reckon I know what I'm about?  Don't I generly know what I'm\n",

      "\n",
      "That's all he said, and that's all I said.  It warn't no use to say any\n",
      "more; because when he said he'd do a thing, he always done it.  But I\n",
      "couldn't make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just\n",
      "let it go, and never bothered no more about it.  If he was bound to have\n",

      "\n",
      "When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to\n",
      "the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it.  We went through the yard\n",
      "so as to see what the hounds would do.  They knowed us, and didn't make\n",
      "no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by\n",
      "in the night.  When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and\n",
      "the two sides; and on the side I warn't acquainted withwhich was the\n",
      "north sidewe found a square window-hole, up tolerable high, with just\n",
      "one stout board nailed across it.  I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here's the ticket.  This hole's big enough for Jim to get through if we\n",
      "wrench off the board.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as\n",

      "complicated than _that_, Huck Finn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, then,\" I says, \"how 'll it do to saw him out, the way I done\n",
      "before I was murdered that time?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's more _like_,\" he says.  \"It's real mysterious, and troublesome,\n",
      "and good,\" he says; \"but I bet we can find a way that's twice as long.\n",
      " There ain't no hurry; le's keep on looking around.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that\n",
      "joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank.  It was as long\n",
      "as the hut, but narrowonly about six foot wide.  The door to it was at\n",
      "the south end, and was padlocked.  Tom he went to the soap-kettle and\n",
      "searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with;\n",
      "so he took it and prized out one of the staples.  The chain fell down,\n",
      "and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match,\n",
      "and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn't no connection\n",
      "with it; and there warn't no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but\n",
      "some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow.\n",
      " The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and\n",
      "the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful.  He says;\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now we're all right.  We'll _dig_ him out.  It 'll take about a week!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we started for the house, and I went in the back dooryou only have\n",
      "to pull a buckskin latch-string, they don't fasten the doorsbut that\n",
      "warn't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must\n",
      "climb up the lightning-rod.  But after he got up half way about three\n",
      "times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most\n",
      "busted his brains out, he thought he'd got to give it up; but after he\n",
      "was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this\n",
      "time he made the trip.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins\n",
      "to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jimif it\n",
      "_was_ Jim that was being fed.  The niggers was just getting through\n",
      "breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim's nigger was piling up\n",
      "a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was\n",
      "leaving, the key come from the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was\n",
      "all tied up in little bunches with thread.  That was to keep witches\n",
      "off.  He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and\n",
      "making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of\n",
      "strange words and noises, and he didn't believe he was ever witched so\n",
      "long before in his life.  He got so worked up, and got to running on so\n",
      "about his troubles, he forgot all about what he'd been a-going to do.\n",
      " So Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the vittles for?  Going to feed the dogs?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face, like when you\n",
      "heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Mars Sid, A dog.  Cur'us dog, too.  Does you want to go en look at\n",
      "'im?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes.\"\n",

      "\"No, it warn't; but it's the plan _now_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So, drat him, we went along, but I didn't like it much.  When we got in\n",
      "we couldn't hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure\n",
      "enough, and could see us; and he sings out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, _Huck_!  En good _lan_'! ain' dat Misto Tom?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it.  I didn't know\n",
      "nothing to do; and if I had I couldn't a done it, because that nigger\n",
      "busted in and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "We could see pretty well now.  Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and\n",
      "kind of wondering, and says:\n",

      "\"Does _who_ know us?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, that's mighty curious.  _Who_ sung out? _when_ did he sing out?\n",
      " _what_ did he sing out?\" And turns to me, perfectly ca'm, and says,\n",
      "\"Did _you_ hear anybody sing out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course there warn't nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No; I ain't heard nobody say nothing.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before,\n",
      "and says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you sing out?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, sah,\" says Jim; \"I hain't said nothing, sah.\"\n",

      "So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and\n",
      "says, kind of severe:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What do you reckon's the matter with you, anyway?  What made you think\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about,\n",

      "That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took\n",
      "one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard\n",
      "Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn't wake him.  Then we\n",
      "whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half\n",
      "the job was done.  We crept in under Jim's bed and into the cabin, and\n",
      "pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile,\n",
      "and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle\n",
      "and gradual.  He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us\n",
      "honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us\n",

      "unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans,\n",

      "not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, _sure_.\n",
      " So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old\n",

      "I said, \"Don't do nothing of the kind; it's one of the most jackass\n",

      "on.  It was his way when he'd got his plans set.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he told Jim how we'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other\n",
      "large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the\n",
      "lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and\n",
      "we would put small things in uncle's coat-pockets and he must steal them\n",
      "out; and we would tie things to aunt's apron-strings or put them in her\n",

      "what they was for.  And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with\n",
      "his blood, and all that. He told him everything.  Jim he couldn't see\n",
      "no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed\n",
      "better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just\n",
      "as Tom said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good\n",
      "sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to\n",
      "bed, with hands that looked like they'd been chawed.  Tom was in high\n",
      "spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the\n",
      "most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would\n",
      "keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to\n",
      "get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the\n",
      "more he got used to it.  He said that in that way it could be strung out\n",
      "to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record.  And he\n",

      "\n",
      "In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass\n",

      "his pocket.  Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat's\n",
      "notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a\n",
      "corn-pone that was in Jim's pan, and we went along with Nat to see how\n",
      "it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most\n",
      "mashed all his teeth out; and there warn't ever anything could a worked\n",
      "better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only\n",
      "just a piece of rock or something like that that's always getting into\n",
      "bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he\n",

      "And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a\n",

      "piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn't hardly room\n",
      "in there to get your breath.  By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to\n",

      "over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was\n",

      "and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back\n",
      "again and shut the door, and I knowed he'd fixed the other door too.\n",

      "spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming, and then Tom went to\n",
      "counting the spoons and laying them out to one side, and I slid one of\n",
      "them up my sleeve, and Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Aunt Sally, there ain't but nine spoons _yet_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Go 'long to your play, and don't bother me.  I know better, I counted\n",
      "'m myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I've counted them twice, Aunty, and I can't make but nine.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "She looked out of all patience, but of course she come to countanybody\n",
      "would.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I declare to gracious ther' _ain't_ but nine!\" she says.  \"Why, what in\n",
      "the worldplague _take_ the things, I'll count 'm again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I slipped back the one I had, and when she got done counting, she\n",
      "says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hang the troublesome rubbage, ther's _ten_ now!\" and she looked huffy\n",
      "and bothered both.  But Tom says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why, Aunty, I don't think there's ten.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You numskull, didn't you see me _count 'm?_\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well, I'll count 'm _again_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So I smouched one, and they come out nine, same as the other time.\n",
      " Well, she _was_ in a tearing wayjust a-trembling all over, she was so\n",
      "mad.  But she counted and counted till she got that addled she'd start\n",
      "to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes; and so, three times they\n",
      "come out right, and three times they come out wrong.  Then she grabbed\n",
      "up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat\n",
      "galley-west; and she said cle'r out and let her have some peace, and if\n",
      "we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she'd skin\n",
      "us.  So we had the odd spoon, and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst\n",
      "she was a-giving us our sailing orders, and Jim got it all right, along\n",
      "with her shingle nail, before noon.  We was very well satisfied with\n",
      "this business, and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took,\n",
      "because he said _now_ she couldn't ever count them spoons twice alike\n",
      "again to save her life; and wouldn't believe she'd counted them right if\n",
      "she _did_; and said that after she'd about counted her head off for the\n",
      "next three days he judged she'd give it up and offer to kill anybody\n",
      "that wanted her to ever count them any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we put the sheet back on the line that night, and stole one out of\n",
      "her closet; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a\n",
      "couple of days till she didn't know how many sheets she had any more,\n",
      "and she didn't _care_, and warn't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her\n",
      "soul out about it, and wouldn't count them again not to save her life;\n",
      "she druther die first.\n",
      "\n",
      "So we was all right now, as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon\n",
      "and the candles, by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up\n",
      "counting; and as to the candlestick, it warn't no consequence, it would\n",
      "blow over by and by.\n",
      "\n",
      "But that pie was a job; we had no end of trouble with that pie.  We\n",
      "fixed it up away down in the woods, and cooked it there; and we got it\n",
      "done at last, and very satisfactory, too; but not all in one day; and we\n",
      "had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through, and\n",
      "we got burnt pretty much all over, in places, and eyes put out with\n",
      "the smoke; because, you see, we didn't want nothing but a crust, and we\n",
      "couldn't prop it up right, and she would always cave in.  But of course\n",
      "we thought of the right way at lastwhich was to cook the ladder, too,\n",
      "in the pie.  So then we laid in with Jim the second night, and tore\n",
      "up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together, and long\n",
      "before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person\n",
      "with.  We let on it took nine months to make it.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods, but it wouldn't go\n",
      "into the pie.  Being made of a whole sheet, that way, there was rope\n",
      "enough for forty pies if we'd a wanted them, and plenty left over\n",
      "for soup, or sausage, or anything you choose.  We could a had a whole\n",
      "dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we didn't need it.  All we needed was just enough for the pie, and\n",
      "so we throwed the rest away.  We didn't cook none of the pies in the\n",

      "ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things\n",
      "that was valuable, not on account of being any account, because they\n",
      "warn't, but on account of them being relicts, you know, and we snaked\n",

      "pies, because we didn't know how, but she come up smiling on the last\n",
      "one.  We took and lined her with dough, and set her in the coals, and\n",
      "loaded her up with rag rope, and put on a dough roof, and shut down the\n",
      "lid, and put hot embers on top, and stood off five foot, with the long\n",
      "handle, cool and comfortable, and in fifteen minutes she turned out a\n",
      "pie that was a satisfaction to look at. But the person that et it would\n",
      "want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along, for if that rope\n",
      "ladder wouldn't cramp him down to business I don't know nothing what I'm\n",

      "over, and she come mighty near mashing us every time.  Tom said she was\n",
      "going to get one of us, sure, before we got through.  We got her half\n",
      "way; and then we was plumb played out, and most drownded with sweat.  We\n",
      "see it warn't no use; we got to go and fetch Jim. So he raised up his\n",

      "IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and\n",

      "we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones; and then we took it and put\n",
      "it in a safe place under Aunt Sally's bed.  But while we was gone for\n",
      "spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found\n",

      "a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain, and the rats was doing what\n",
      "they could to keep off the dull times for her.  So she took and dusted\n",

      "\n",
      "We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders, and bugs, and frogs, and\n",
      "caterpillars, and one thing or another; and we like to got a hornet's\n",
      "nest, but we didn't.  The family was at home.  We didn't give it right\n",
      "up, but stayed with them as long as we could; because we allowed we'd\n",
      "tire them out or they'd got to tire us out, and they done it.  Then we\n",
      "got allycumpain and rubbed on the places, and was pretty near all right\n",
      "again, but couldn't set down convenient.  And so we went for the snakes,\n",
      "and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes, and put them in\n",
      "a bag, and put it in our room, and by that time it was supper-time, and\n",

      "generly landed in your plate, or down the back of your neck, and most\n",
      "of the time where you didn't want them.  Well, they was handsome and\n",
      "striped, and there warn't no harm in a million of them; but that never\n",
      "made no difference to Aunt Sally; she despised snakes, be the breed what\n",

      "near over it; when she was setting thinking about something you could\n",

      "right out of her stockings.  It was very curious.  But Tom said all\n",

      "because they didn't amount to nothing; but I minded the trouble we\n",
      "had to lay in another lot.  But we got them laid in, and all the other\n",
      "things; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim's was when they'd\n",
      "all swarm out for music and go for him.  Jim didn't like the spiders,\n",
      "and the spiders didn't like Jim; and so they'd lay for him, and make it\n",
      "mighty warm for him.  And he said that between the rats and the snakes\n",
      "and the grindstone there warn't no room in bed for him, skasely; and\n",
      "when there was, a body couldn't sleep, it was so lively, and it was\n",
      "always lively, he said, because _they_ never all slept at one time, but\n",
      "took turn about, so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck, and\n",
      "when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch, so he always had one\n",
      "gang under him, in his way, and t'other gang having a circus over him,\n",

      "a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their\n",
      "runaway nigger, but hadn't got no answer, because there warn't no such\n",
      "plantation; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and\n",
      "New Orleans papers; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me\n",
      "the cold shivers, and I see we hadn't no time to lose. So Tom said, now\n",
      "for the nonnamous letters.\n",

      "\n",

      "gives notice to the governor of the castle.  When Louis XVI. was going\n",
      "to light out of the Tooleries, a servant-girl done it.  It's a very good\n",
      "way, and so is the nonnamous letters.  We'll use them both.  And it's\n",
      "usual for the prisoner's mother to change clothes with him, and she\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I know; but you can't depend on them.  It's the way they've acted\n",
      "from the very startleft us to do _everything_.  They're so confiding\n",
      "and mullet-headed they don't take notice of nothing at all.  So if we\n",
      "don't _give_ them notice there won't be nobody nor nothing to interfere\n",
      "with us, and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go\n",

      "\"Well, as for me, Tom, that's the way I'd like.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Shucks!\" he says, and looked disgusted.  So I says:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I ain't going to make no complaint.  Any way that suits you suits\n",
      "me. What you going to do about the servant-girl?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You'll be her.  You slide in, in the middle of the night, and hook that\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Why, Tom, that 'll make trouble next morning; because, of course, she\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I know; but you don't want it but fifteen minutes, to carry the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"All right, then, I'll do it; but I could carry it just as handy in my\n",

      "\"No, but there won't be nobody to see what I look like, _anyway_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That ain't got nothing to do with it.  The thing for us to do is just\n",

      "not. Hain't you got no principle at all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right, I ain't saying nothing; I'm the servant-girl.  Who's Jim's\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Not much.  I'll stuff Jim's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed\n",
      "to represent his mother in disguise, and Jim 'll take the nigger woman's\n",
      "gown off of me and wear it, and we'll all evade together.  When a\n",
      "prisoner of style escapes it's called an evasion.  It's always called\n",
      "so when a king escapes, f'rinstance.  And the same with a king's son;\n",
      "it don't make no difference whether he's a natural one or an unnatural\n",
      "one.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter, and I smouched the yaller wench's\n",
      "frock that night, and put it on, and shoved it under the front door, the\n",

      "Next night we stuck a picture, which Tom drawed in blood, of a skull and\n",
      "crossbones on the front door; and next night another one of a coffin on\n",

      "been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them\n",
      "behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air.  If\n",
      "a door banged, Aunt Sally she jumped and said \"ouch!\" if anything fell,\n",
      "she jumped and said \"ouch!\" if you happened to touch her, when she\n",
      "warn't noticing, she done the same; she couldn't face noway and be\n",
      "satisfied, because she allowed there was something behind her every\n",
      "timeso she was always a-whirling around sudden, and saying \"ouch,\" and\n",
      "before she'd got two-thirds around she'd whirl back again, and say it\n",
      "again; and she was afraid to go to bed, but she dasn't set up.  So the\n",

      "more satisfactory. He said it showed it was done right.\n",
      "\n",
      "So he said, now for the grand bulge!  So the very next morning at the\n",
      "streak of dawn we got another letter ready, and was wondering what we\n",
      "better do with it, because we heard them say at supper they was going\n",
      "to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night.  Tom he went down the\n",
      "lightning-rod to spy around; and the nigger at the back door was asleep,\n",

      "along the fence, at midnight exact, with a false key, and go in the\n",
      "nigger's cabin to get him. I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn\n",
      "if I see any danger; but stead of that I will _baa_ like a sheep soon as\n",
      "they get in and not blow at all; then whilst they are getting his\n",

      "\n",
      "THE doctor was an old man; a very nice, kind-looking old man when I got\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "when he sees the canoe he didn't like the look of hersaid she was big\n",
      "enough for one, but didn't look pretty safe for two.  I says:\n",
      "\n",

      "and said he reckoned he'd look around for a bigger one.  But they was\n",
      "all locked and chained; so he took my canoe, and said for me to wait\n",
      "till he come back, or I could hunt around further, or maybe I better\n",
      "go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to.  But\n",
      "I said I didn't; so I told him just how to find the raft, and then he\n",
      "started.\n",
      "\n",
      "I struck an idea pretty soon.  I says to myself, spos'n he can't fix\n",

      "around there till he lets the cat out of the bag?  No, sir; I know what\n",
      "_I'll_ do.  I'll wait, and when he comes back if he says he's got to\n",
      "go any more I'll get down there, too, if I swim; and we'll take and tie\n",
      "him, and keep him, and shove out down the river; and when Tom's done\n",
      "with him we'll give him what it's worth, or all we got, and then let him\n",
      "get ashore.\n",
      "\n",
      "So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep; and next time I\n",

      "or other, and warn't back yet.  Well, thinks I, that looks powerful bad\n",
      "for Tom, and I'll dig out for the island right off.  So away I shoved,\n",
      "and turned the corner, and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas's\n",

      "crossed over, but couldn't find nothing of them; so we cruised along\n",
      "up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out; and tied up the canoe\n",
      "and went to sleep, and never waked up till about an hour ago; then we\n",
      "paddled over here to hear the news, and Sid's at the post-office to see\n",

      "\n",
      "So then we went to the post-office to get \"Sid\"; but just as I\n",
      "suspicioned, he warn't there; so the old man he got a letter out of the\n",

      "heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they\n",
      "didn't think of it, and I reckoned it warn't best for me to mix in, but\n",
