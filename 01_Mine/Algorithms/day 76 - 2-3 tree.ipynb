    "# 2-3 Tree\n",
    "[2–3 tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2%E2%80%933_tree) is a perfectly balanced [binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree). Which means that every path from root to leaf has the same length and the data structure guarantees worst case O(log n) time complexity for search and insert operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference to regular BST I have talked about on day 45?\n",
    "\n",
    "2–3 tree extends node capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **2-node** contains a single value and has two children [unless it is leaf]\n",
    "* **3-node **contains two values and has three children [unless it is leaf]\n",
    "\n",
    "To insert a value into 2–3 tree, find proper leaf as in regular BST and insert the value in-place. If the leaf now contains 3 values, it is called **temporary 4-node**. Split the node into three 2-nodes, and insert the middle value into parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "![day76-23tree](resource/day76-23tree.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "While this all sounds good, 2–3 trees are very difficult and tricky to implement. But there is a way to implement them in a very nice and efficient way — using a left-leaning variant of red-black trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me tell you, back at the university I had to know how to implement and prove all the stuff around red-black trees. Yet, I never really understood the intuition behind, until I saw the left-leaning variant which is very simple to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement 2-node as regular node, but mark the node and its children **black**. 3-nodes are implemented such that the lower value is child of higher value and is marked **red**.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a value is inserted into leaf, it is **red** by default. Then traverse back up to the root and check the following invariants.\n",
    "\n",
    "* only left child can be **red** — if left child is **black** and right child is **red**, rotate the node to left\n",
    "* **red** parent can’t have **red** child — if so, rotate the node to right\n",
    "* parent can’t have two **red** children — if so, mark them **black** and make the parent **red**\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires some drawing on the paper, but the operations are very intuitive and one-to-one reflect operations in 2–3 tree."
