    "# Coin success runs\n",
    "What is the probability to see a success run of 10 heads if we toss a fair coin thousand times?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be tempted to answer 1/2¹⁰, but this problem is really non-trivial. Such an intuitive [mis]understanding of probability is often source of [gambler’s fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Derivation and proof of the correct answer is way beyond this series. In this case I will only show a general solution and provide its implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would also like to express my gratitude to professor [Santosh S. Venkatesh](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~venkates/). His excellent lectures and [book](https://www.amazon.com/Theory-Probability-Explorations-Applications/dp/1107024471/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1497725296&sr=8-1&keywords=venkatesh+probability) helped me to understand probability and statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s denote\n",
    "\n",
    "* `r` — length of success run\n",
    "* `p` — probability of tossing heads\n",
    "* `u[n]` — a success run (first or subsequent) of length r occurs at trial `n`\n",
    "* `f[n]` — the first success run of length `r` occurs at trial `n`\n",
    "* `s[n]` — at least one success run of length `r`occurs at or before trial `n`\n",
    "\n",
    "$u_n = p^r-p^1u_{n-1}-p^2u{n-2}-...-p{r-1}u_{n-r+1}$\n",
    "$f_n=u_n-f_1u_{n-1}-f_2u_{n-2}-...-f_{n-1}u_1$\n",
    "$s_n=f_1+f_2+...+f_n$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To get an answer for the question I laid, we set `r=10`, `p=.5` and find `s[1000]`. List of probabilities below gives the answer. Probability to see a success run of 10 heads within thousand tosses is 39%."
