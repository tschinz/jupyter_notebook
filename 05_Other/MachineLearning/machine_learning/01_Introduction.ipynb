    "The material presented will include both the *Bayesian* and *frequentist* approaches. The labels, or even their *\"proper\"* use is, in practical terms, of little consequence. \n",
    "The important considerations are, as in any modeling, what assumptions are being made to create a given mathematical model and how do those \n",
    "assumptions affect model quality. However, in an effort to be consistent with the literature, I will attempt to use these terms where appropriate. \n",
    "With respect to Bayesian modeling vs. frequentist modeling the most fundamental difference is how data is viewed. In simplistic terms, the \n",
    "Bayesian approach asserts that their is some prior knowledge about the distribution of the data and model parameters. This prior knowledge alone could be used to make \n",
    "predictions about the future observation - however poor they may be. Once data is observed, it is used to *modulate* the prior assumptions.\n",
    "The frenquentist approach tends to ignore any such prior knowledge - relying more heavily, or even completely, on the observed data. Both approaches, of course, have\n",

    "<h2>A Little Probability</h2>\n",

    "Now assume we have a second RV, $Y$. The probability that $X$ and $Y$ together take some particular value $(x,y)$ is the *joint probability* $p_{X,Y}(x,y)=p(X=x, Y=y)$. The\n",
    "joint probability can be defined in terms of conditional and marginal probabilities as follows:\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",

    "**sum rule**     $p(X)=\\sum_Yp\\left(X,Y\\right)$\n",

    "where the *conditional probability*, $p_X(X|Y)$ , is the probability distribution of X given that Y has taken some specific value and $p_X(x)$ is the *marginal probability*. Note\n",
    "that the marginal probability is simply the probability distribution of $X$ as described above, but when considered as part of a larger set of RVs, as in $(X,Y)$ in this case, the \n",
